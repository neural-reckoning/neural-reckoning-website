    <b>Note on Brexit.</b> Unless further negotiation with the EU changes things, currently EU students are considered
    the same as students from any other non-EU country. I will update this page if the situation changes. See the

    Brexit FAQ</a> for more details.

    <h4 class="card-header">① Check if the topic is suitable</h4>
    <div class="card-body">
        Read the <a href="openings.html">general information</a> on PhD positions, including suggested
        topics. Note: I'm interested in supervising work in computational neuroscience broadly, and not
        in pure machine learning. So if you are looking for a machine learning PhD and you are not
        interested in neuroscience, please do not apply.

    <h4 class="card-header">② Check the entry requirements</h4>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>
            For a funded PhD position, you should have a bachelor and masters level degree (integrated or separate)
            equivalent to a UK <b>first class</b> (bachelor) and <b>distinction</b> (master). If one of these two grades is equivalent
            to a UK 2-1 (bachelor) or merit (master) you may still be able to apply if you have publications or
            other research experience (e.g. in industry).
        </p>
        <p>
            For more details on minimum entry requirements, please see the
            <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/requirements/">PhD requirements</a> page
            (and the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/requirements/pgacademic/">Country-specific
            requirements</a>). Note that funding is competitive and usually requires grades substantially higher than the
            minimum requirements (see below).

<div class="card">
    <h4 class="card-header">③ Submit a pre-submission enquiry</h4>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>
            Use the pre-submission enquiry page to see if your suggested topic and background are appropriate
            for my group.
            Note that I usually reply to pre-submission enquiries within a week or two, whereas the full
            application procedure takes 6-8 weeks.

    <div class="card-body">
        <p>
            Full applications are submitted through the Imperial College system. You will need to write a research statement
            of 1-2 pages in addition to your transcripts, references, and English language test results (if applicable).
            Applications are processed by Imperial College admin, a process that normally takes 6-8 weeks before it is sent
            to me.

    <h4 class="card-header">⑤ Interview</h4>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>
            If your application is successful, you will be invited to an interview.
            Interviews are with me and one other faculty 
            member at Imperial, and typically last around one hour. We will send you a
            paper to read a week in advance, and ask you to summarise and discuss it
            in the interview. We will normally ask you to talk about previous project
            work, and what you would like to work on (in broad terms) during your PhD.
            We will not ask you to solve puzzles or problems. You will have an
            opportunity to ask us questions, and we will also put you in touch with
            one of our current PhD students to chat to in confidence. I will let you
            know the outcome of the interview within a week normally.
        </p>

<div class="card">
    <h4 class="card-header">⑥ Funding</h4>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p>
            If successful at the interview stage, you will be given a formal offer,
            but this does not come with funding. I will submit your application for consideration for
            Imperial College funding. This is assessed competitively at a panel that meets every few
            months. I will let you know when the panel takes place, and offers are usually made within
            two weeks after the panel. There are
            other options for funding including the China Scholarship Council. For more information about funding options,
            see <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/study/phd/funding-and-scholarships/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: I do not accept self-funded students.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Imperial College funding</b>. Normally an undergraduate or masters qualification at an equivalent level to a UK 1st or Distinction is
            required, but a lower grade may be possible if you already have publications or other experience.
            You can get a rough idea of UK equivalency
            <a href="https://www.grb.uk.com/recruiter-research/international-degree-equivalents">here</a> (although this is
            not guaranteed to be accurate).
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-degree-equivalency-table-and-methodology">This
            document</a> has been withdrawn but gives slightly more detail of these equivalencies for many countries.
