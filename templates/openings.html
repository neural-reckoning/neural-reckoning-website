<h2>Openings</h2>

<h3>PhD</h3>

<p>
I am interested in supervising students with a strong mathematical, computational or neuroscience
background. Projects could be carried out in several possible areas relating to the
<a href="index.html">work in the group</a>. Some suggestions for topics
that would be interesting to me are below, but I'm very happy to consider
other possibilities. 
In addition to working within the group, studying at Imperial College provides excellent
opportunities for interacting with other theoretical and experimental researchers, both at
Imperial and in the many  neuroscience groups in London.
</p>

<p>
Applicants for a PhD position should initially
<a href="dan_goodman.html">send me</a> a brief CV and cover letter with
a description of research interests or a proposed project, and will eventually have to formally
apply through the standard Imperial College mechanism (for more information, see
<a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/electricalengineering/courses/phd">here</a>).
There are several opportunities for funding which we can discuss if you are
offered a position.
Note that a masters degree is required for PhD study at Imperial: please see the
<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/requirements/">PhD requirements</a> page
(and the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/requirements/pgacademic/">Country-specific
requirements</a>).

    <b>Note on Brexit.</b> Offers made before Brexit will be respected in terms of funding, so early
    applications are encouraged. See the
    <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/imperial-and-the-european-union/support-for-students/">Imperial College

<h3>Postdoctoral</h3>

<p>
I do not currently have any open postdoctoral positions, but please get in touch
if you are interested in applying for your own funding through a fellowship
scheme, for example.

<h2>Themes and suggested topics</h2>

<h3>Machine learning and neuroscience</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Hypothesis generation.</i> The unique quality of the brain is its ability
        to solve complex tasks in difficult environments. Modern machine learning
        enables us for the first time to design models that can perform comparably to
        the brain. Can we use techniques from machine learning combined with our
        limited knowledge of the structure of the brain to suggest hypotheses for the
        computational roles of neural components?
        <br/><a href="pub_data_driven_auditory_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Brain-inspired architectures.</i> One of the most successful machine
        learning techniques in recent years is the convolutional neural network
        which is inspired by the structure of the visual system. Can we find other
        powerful architectures inspired by different areas of the brain?
        <br/><a href="pub_attention_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Machine listening.</i> There has been incredibly successful work in
        visual recognition using machine learning, but the auditory equivalent is
        relatively less well studied.
        <br/><a href="pub_data_driven_auditory_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Robustness.</i> Machine learning techniques such as deep networks are
        often not robust in the same way as the brain (for example,
        <a href="https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/">adversarial images</a>).
        Can we design more robust machine learning techniques inspired by the brain?
        <br/><a href="pub_heterogeneity_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication 1]</a>
        <a href="pub_attention_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication 2]</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Neural processing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Spiking neurons.</i> Implementing functional networks using
        spiking neurons. Investigating the advantages of disadvantages
        of spiking versus artificial neurons. Are there computations that
        fundamentally require spiking neurons?
        <br/><a href="pub_spike_timing_sound_loc.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Heterogeneity.</i> There is a great deal of theory on
        homogeneous networks of neurons, but heterogeneity (of neuron
        properties for example) may be functionally important.
        <br/><a href="pub_heterogeneity_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Temporal processing.</i> The brain has to process a continuous
        stream of sensory information which can arrive at unexpected times and
        may need to be rapidly processed. The temporal structure of the
        input at fast timescales may be important (particularly in the
        auditory system).
        <br/><a href="pub_spike_timing_sound_loc.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Multiplexing.</i> Model neurons or networks usually address only a
        single task, however in the brain it appears neurons are involved
        in multiple computations simultaneously and may multiplex information
        or computations.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Auditory and other sensory systems</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Sound localisation.</i> Few models of sound localisation are able
        to handle the complexity of real acoustic environments, with
        multiple sources, background noise, reverberation, etc.
        <br/><a href="pub_decoding_soundloc.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Auditory scene analysis and the cocktail party problem.</i> How
        do we separate out multiple sound sources and either listen to them
        all or focus on a single one? This is very relevant to the problem of
        speech recognition in the presence of background noise or multiple
        speakers, which is an unsolved problem.
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Binding.</i> How do we group multiple features (auditory or across
        modalities) into underlying objects?
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Simulation and data analysis</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Neural simulation.</i> I'm always interested in work on techniques
        for neural simulation, and encourage anyone who works with me to contribute
        to the <a href="http://briansimulator.org/">Brian simulator</a>.
        <br/><a href="pub_brian2.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Analysing large scale neural data.</i>
        New experimental techniques are becoming available which provide several
        orders of magnitude more data than were previously available, but there is not yet
        agreement on methods for using this data to understand how the brain functions.
