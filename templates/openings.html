<h2>Openings</h2>

<h3>PhD</h3>

<p>
I am interested in supervising students with a strong mathematical, computational or neuroscience
background. Projects could be carried out in several possible areas relating to the
<a href="index.html">work in the group</a>. Some suggestions for topics
that would be interesting to me are below, but I'm very happy to consider
other possibilities. 
In addition to working within the group, studying at Imperial College provides excellent
opportunities for interacting with other theoretical and experimental researchers, both at
Imperial (recently ranked 8th in the world in the QS world university rankings) and in the many
neuroscience groups in London.
</p>

<p>
Applicants for a PhD position should initially
<a href="dan_goodman.html">send me</a> a brief CV and cover letter with
a description of research interests or a proposed project, and will eventually have to formally
apply through the standard Imperial College mechanism (for more information, see
<a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/electricalengineering/courses/phd">here</a>).
There are several opportunities for funding which we can discuss if you are
offered a position.
Note that a masters degree is required for PhD study at Imperial: please see the
<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/requirements/">PhD requirements</a> page
(and the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/requirements/pgacademic/">Country-specific
requirements</a>).
</p>

<p>
I am also interested in supervising PhD students in
<a href="neuroinformatics.html">neuroinformatics</a> as part of the
<a href="http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/hipeds/">HiPEDS CDT</a> (Centre for Doctoral
Training in High Performance Embedded and Distributed Systems). Note that although this course
includes a 1 year taught MRes component, a masters degree is required for entry.
</p>

<h3>Postdoctoral</h3>

<p>
I do not currently have any open postdoctoral positions, but please get in touch
if you are interested in applying for your own funding through a fellowship
scheme, for example.

<h2>Suggested topics</h2>

<div>
<ul>
<li>
    Models of spike-based processing of streaming sensory data, that is data
    coming in a continuous stream as opposed to discrete, well delineated
    bursts. This might involve models using adapting neurons and plasticity,
    and cover topics such as binding, auditory scene analysis, and sound
    recognition in noisy environments.
</li>

<li>
    Computational and analytical methods for the analysis of the neural "big data" that will
    be revolutionising neuroscience over the next decade. Over the next couple
    of years, new hardware will become available which will provide several
    orders of magnitude more data than were previously available, and this
    will lead to a major problem as current techniques for analysing this sort
    of data are not scalable.
</li>

<li>
    Spiking neural network simulation on non-standard computational hardware,
    such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), graphics processing
    units (GPUs) and the
    <a href="http://apt.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/SpiNNaker/">SpiNNaker</a>
    spiking neural network supercomputer. As neuroscientists study ever
    larger systems the need for large scale simulations is rapidly growing,
    but the techniques and hardware to do so are out of reach of the majority
    of neuroscience researchers. These innovative types of computational
    hardware have the potential to solve these problems, but substantial
    work is still required to implement realistic models on them in a way
    that is accessible to neuroscientists without deep technical training.
</li>

<li>
    Real-time applications of spiking neural network models, for example in
    robotics. Until fairly recently, spiking neuron models were too
    computationally expensive to run on robotics platforms which require
    real-time operations. New developments have made this possible, but there
    are still very few studies which do so, despite the huge promise of these
    types of models.
</li>

</ul>
