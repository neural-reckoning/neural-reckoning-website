<p>
The Neural Reckoning Group is led by
<a href="dan_goodman.html">Dan Goodman</a>. It is part of the
<a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/intellisysnetworks">Intelligent
Systems and Networks group</a> in the
<a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/electricalengineering">Department
of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a> at
<a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>.

<p>
The brain processes information using highly connected parallel networks of
neurons communicating via precisely timed, discrete neural impulses (called "spikes").
This spike-based form of computation is specific to the brain, being radically
different to conventional digital and analogue computation. The aim of our
research is to uncover the principles underlying spike-based neuronal
computation, both as a fundamental research problem and with an eye to
applications in intelligent systems and neural prosthetics (as we know that
brains massively outperform state of the art algorithms).

<p>
Specifically, we work in two main domains: neuroinformatics and sensory
neuroscience.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <a href="neuroinformatics.html"><b>Neuroinformatics</b></a> is the
    application of computational methods
    in neuroscience, and we are particularly interested in the simulation of
    spiking neural networks and the analysis of experimentally recorded spiking
    data (see <a href="software.html">Software</a>).
    </li>
    
    <li>
    In the domain of <a href="sensory.html"><b>sensory neuroscience</b></a>, we
    have worked primarily in
    the auditory system as the significance of spike-timing is so clearly
    established there. We use complex stimuli (such as natural sounds) to better
    understand the functioning of sensory systems in realistic environments.
