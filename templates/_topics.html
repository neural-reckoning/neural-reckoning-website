<h2>Themes and suggested topics</h2>

<p>
    I am particularly interested at the moment in applying methods from machine
    learning to models with a more biological flavour than the artificial neural
    networks typically studied in machine learning. This could include neurons
    with temporal dynamics, spiking neurons, etc. The aim is to use
    machine learning methods to find biologically relevant insights. To get a
    feel for this sort of work, you might be interested in seeing some of the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SrEycIbfRE&list=PL09WqqDbQWHFvM9DFYkM_GfnrVnIdLRhy">recorded
    talks</a> from a recent <a href="https://neural-reckoning.github.io/snn_workshop_2020/">workshop
    I organised</a>.
</p>

<p>
    With that said, all of the topics below are interesting to me, and if one of these
    suggestions particularly resonates with you, the most rewarding for me is
    always to work with someone on a topic they also find exciting.

                <i>Hypothesis generation.</i> The unique quality of the brain is its ability
                to solve complex tasks in difficult environments. Modern machine learning
                enables us for the first time to design models that can perform comparably to
                the brain. Can we use techniques from machine learning combined with our
                limited knowledge of the structure of the brain to suggest hypotheses for the
                computational roles of neural components?

                <i>Brain-inspired architectures.</i> One of the most successful machine
                learning techniques in recent years is the convolutional neural network
                which is inspired by the structure of the visual system. Can we find other
                powerful architectures inspired by different areas of the brain?

            <li>
                <i>Machine listening.</i> There has been incredibly successful work in
                visual recognition using machine learning, but the auditory equivalent is
                relatively less well studied.

            <li>
                <i>Robustness.</i> Machine learning techniques such as deep networks are
                often not robust in the same way as the brain (for example,
                <a href="https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/">adversarial images</a>).
                Can we design more robust machine learning techniques inspired by the brain?

                <i>Spiking neurons.</i> Implementing functional networks using
                spiking neurons. Investigating the advantages of disadvantages
                of spiking versus artificial neurons. Are there computations that
                fundamentally require spiking neurons?

            <li>
                <i>Heterogeneity.</i> There is a great deal of theory on
                homogeneous networks of neurons, but heterogeneity (of neuron
                properties for example) may be functionally important.

            <li>
                <i>Temporal processing.</i> The brain has to process a continuous
                stream of sensory information which can arrive at unexpected times and
                may need to be rapidly processed. The temporal structure of the
                input at fast timescales may be important (particularly in the
                auditory system).

            <li>
                <i>Multiplexing.</i> Model neurons or networks usually address only a
                single task, however in the brain it appears neurons are involved
                in multiple computations simultaneously and may multiplex information
                or computations.

                all or focus on a single one? This is very relevant to the problem of
                speech recognition in the presence of background noise or multiple
                speakers, which is an unsolved problem.

                New experimental techniques are becoming available which provide several

                agreement on methods for using this data to understand how the brain functions.
