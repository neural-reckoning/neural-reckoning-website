<h2>Research themes</h2>

<p>
    This is an experimental page to visualise the research themes of the lab. Note that some of the visualisations
    do not work well in Internet Explorer. Nodes in the graphs below are clickable and will take you to the
    list of associated publications.
</p>

<h3>Word cloud</h3>

<div class="card show">
  <div class="card-body">
    <img src="wordcloud.png" class="img-fluid">
  </div>
</div>

<p>
    The word cloud is generated from all of the abstracts of <a href="publications.html">publications</a>
    on this site using the <a href="https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/">wordcloud</a> package for
    Python.
</p>

<h3>Connections</h3>

<div class="card show">
  <div class="card-body">
    {% include 'categories_spontaneous.svg' %}
  </div>
</div>

<p>
    The image above is a clickable SVG file generated by <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a> using the
    <emph>neato</emph> layout algorithm. For each pair of categories, we count the number of papers that are in both
    categories. This is then turned into a distance target for the layout algorithm, so that it tries to place
    categories with the lowest number of papers about twice as far away from each other as category pairs with the
    highest number of shared categories. Nodes (categories) are coloured according to the number of papers in that
    category, and edges according to the number of papers in both categories.
</p>

<h3>Hierarchy</h3>

<div class="card show">
  <div class="card-body">
    {% include 'categories_hierarchy.svg' %}
  </div>
</div>

<p>
    The clickable SVG is generated in the same way as the one above but using the hierarchical <emph>dot</emph>
    layout algorithm, and this time using a hand-defined graph of relationships between categories. Arrows indicate that
    the target category is a subset of the source category.
