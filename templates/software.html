                <a href="http://briansimulator.org">Brian</a> is a simulator
                for spiking neural networks. It is written in Python for rapid
                development and ease-of-use, and generates code in several different
                languages for a variety of computational devices for efficient
                execution (for example on GPU via the
                <a href="https://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> simulator using the
                <a href="http://brian2genn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Brian2GeNN</a> package).
                It includes packages for

            <a href="http://klusta-team.github.io/">KlustaSuite</a> is a
            collection of programs for "spike sorting". That is, for
            extracting spike trains from a set of simultaneously recorded
            extracellular traces. This problem involves preprocessing data to
            remove noise, clustering to identify patterns across channels
            that correspond to spikes, and finally manually inspecting and
            refining the output. This software is currently undergoing a
            massive redesign to make it possible to sort spikes using
            enormous electrode arrays with hundreds to thousands of channels.
