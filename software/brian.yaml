  <p>
      A simulator for spiking neural networks. It is written in Python for rapid
      development and ease-of-use, and generates code in several different
      languages for a variety of computational devices for efficient
      execution (for example on GPU via the
      <a href="https://genn-team.github.io/genn/">GeNN</a> simulator using the
      <a href="http://brian2genn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Brian2GeNN</a> package).
      It includes packages for
      <a href="pub_modelfitting_focussed_review.html">automatically
      fitting neuron models to experimental data</a> and for
      <a href="pub_brian_hears.html">modelling the auditory system</a>.
