      A collection of programs for "spike sorting". That is, for
      extracting spike trains from a set of simultaneously recorded
      extracellular traces. This problem involves preprocessing data to
      remove noise, clustering to identify patterns across channels
      that correspond to spikes, and finally manually inspecting and
      refining the output. This software is currently undergoing a
      massive redesign to make it possible to sort spikes using
      enormous electrode arrays with hundreds to thousands of channels.
