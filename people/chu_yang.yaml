    Previously, Yang did his PhD in the lab, working on understanding how the brain achieves robust perception and flexible behaviour in a constantly changing world. He had a particular interest in brain-inspired machine learning models that can handle "distribution shift". He was jointly supervised by <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.luk">Wayne Luk</a> and <a href="https://tbrx.github.io/">Brooks Paige</a>.
