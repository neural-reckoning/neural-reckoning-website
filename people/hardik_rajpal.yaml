  <p>
    I am a Schmidt Sciences Research Fellow with the Intelligent Systems and Networks group and IX at Imperial College London. Guided by a restless curiosity and a complexity science perspective, my research spans opinion dynamics, economic complexity, game theory, evolutionary biology, and computational neuroscience. I am inspired by natural phenomena across scales, which I study using tools from network science, mathematical modelling, and information theory. My current work focuses on the role of self-organization in enabling generalizable learning in artificial neural networks.
