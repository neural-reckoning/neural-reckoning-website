  <p>
  My interests are broad but have lately aligned with the field of neuromorphic engineering. I study the structure-function relationship in neural-networks, understanding how structural modularity relates to functional specialization and compositional knowledge abilities, especially in resource-constrained architectures. I’ve also studied Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), especially the topic of multimodal integration, and I am currently an active developer of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/spinnaker2/py-spinnaker2">SNN software stack for SpiNNaker2</a>. Finally, I am fascinated by self-organising systems and have recently been trying to understand how continuous neural cellular automata can be harnessed as a <a href="https://gabrielbena.github.io/blog/2025/bena2025unca/">universal computational medium</a>.  </p>
