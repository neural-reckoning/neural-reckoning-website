short: Unifying principles of intelligent systems.
long: >
  <p>
  I am a (senior) lecturer (US equivalent: associate professor) in the
  <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/intellisysnetworks">Intelligent
  Systems and Networks group</a> in the
  <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/electricalengineering">Department
  of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a> at
  <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>.</p>

  <p>
      The aim of my research is to uncover unifying principles underlying
      intelligent systems, including biological systems such as the brain,
      and artificial systems.
      My approach is to look at tasks that are
      complex and difficult enough to require a brain to solve them,
      but simple enough to be tractable. I am
      particularly interested in neurally inspired spatiotemporally sparse
      computations, such as computing with precisely
      timed spiking neural networks. This is a form of computation
      specific to the brain, being radically different to both digital and
      analogue computation.
  </p>

  <p>
      I have developed several
      <a href="software.html">software tools</a> for
      working with spiking neurons, notably the
      <a href="http://briansimulator.org">&quot;Brian&quot; spiking neural
      network simulator</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
      I am also interested in open science and making science better.
      I host a list of <a href="comp-neuro-resources.html">freely
      available computational neuroscience resources</a>. I co-founded
      <a href="https://neuromatch.io">Neuromatch</a> with
      <a href="http://kordinglab.com/">Konrad Kording</a>. I was formerly an editor
      for the open access journals
      <a href="https://elifesciences.org">eLife</a>, 
      <a href="https://nbdt.scholasticahq.com/">Neurons, Behavior, Data analysis, and Theory</a>, and
      <a href="https://cneuro.peercommunityin.org/">PCI Circuit Neuroscience</a>,
      however I <a href="reviewing.html">no longer do reviewing or editorial work</a>.
      I discuss my ongoing work on reforming scientific publishing on my blog
      <a href="https://thesamovar.github.io/zavarka/">Zavarka</a>.
