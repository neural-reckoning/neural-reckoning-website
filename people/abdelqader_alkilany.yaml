short: Neuromodulation and neuromorphic computing.
long: |-
  <p>
    My research focuses on simulating neuromodulation using spiking neural networks, with the broader aim of understanding cognition and the mechanisms through which intelligence emerges from algorithmic processes and their physical substrates. I am particularly interested in how computational models can capture aspects of adaptive behaviour and decision-making.

  <p>
    Beyond theoretical modelling, I am also intrigued by applications at the intersection of neuromorphic computing, robotics, and haptics, exploring how brain-inspired architectures can interact with and control embodied systems. This includes examining the role of computer architecture in enabling efficient neuromorphic technologies and their integration into real-world platforms.
