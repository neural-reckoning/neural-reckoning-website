The set of points about which we prove the boundary spirals infinitely has zero measure and is akin to a countable union of Cantor sets. On the basis of strong numerical evidence, we conjecture that in fact the boundary spirals infinitely at almost all points in the boundary. We further conjecture that the Hausdorff dimension of the Maskit slice is less than 1.25."

    "abstract": "Spike timing is precise in the auditory system and it has been argued\nthat it conveys information about auditory stimuli, in particular about\nthe location of a sound source. However, beyond simple time differences,\nthe way in which neurons might extract this information is unclear and\nthe potential computational advantages are unknown. The computational\ndifficulty of this task for an animal is to locate the source of an\nunexpected sound from two monaural signals that are highly dependent on\nthe unknown source signal. In neuron models consisting of\nspectro-temporal filtering and spiking nonlinearity, we found that the\nbinaural structure induced by spatialized sounds is mapped to synchrony\npatterns that depend on source location rather than on source signal.\nLocation-specific synchrony patterns would then result in the activation\nof location-specific assemblies of postsynaptic neurons. We designed a\nspiking neuron model which exploited this principle to locate a variety\nof sound sources in a virtual acoustic environment using measured human\nhead-related transfer functions. The model was able to accurately\nestimate the location of previously unknown sounds in both azimuth and\nelevation (including front/back discrimination) in a known acoustic\nenvironment. We found that multiple representations of different\nacoustic environments could coexist as sets of overlapping neural\nassemblies which could be associated with spatial locations by Hebbian\nlearning. The model demonstrates the computational relevance of relative\nspike timing to extract spatial information about sources independently\nof the source signal.",

Here we propose algorithms to simulate\nthese models by vectorizing computation over frequency channels, which\nare implemented in \"Brian Hears,\" a library for the spiking neural\nnetwork simulator package \"Brian.\" This approach allows us to use\nhigh-level programming languages such as Python, because with vectorized\noperations, the computational cost of interpretation represents a small\nfraction of the total cost. This makes it possible to define and\nsimulate complex models in a simple way, while all previous\nimplementations were model-specific. In addition, we show that these\nalgorithms can be naturally parallelized using graphics processing\nunits, yielding substantial speed improvements.

Rodent barrel\ncortex contains a somatotopic map for vibrissa identity, but the\nexistence of maps representing other tactile features has not been\nclearly demonstrated. We addressed the issue of the existence in the rat\ncortex of an intrabarrel map for vibrissa movement direction using in\nvivo two-photon imaging. We discovered that the emergence of a direction\nmap in rat barrel cortex occurs long after all known critical periods\nin the somatosensory system. This map is remarkably specific, taking a\npinwheel-like form centered near the barrel center and aligned to the\nbarrel cortex somatotopy. We suggest that this map may arise from\nintracortical mechanisms and demonstrate by simulation that the\ncombination of spike-timing-dependent plasticity at synapses between\nlayer 4 and layer 2/3 and realistic pad stimulation is sufficient to\nproduce such a map. Its late emergence long after other classical maps\nsuggests that experience-dependent map formation and refinement continue\nthroughout adult life. ",

    "abstract": "<p>We demonstrate how an abstract mathematical model that approximates a wide range of more \ndetailed models can be used to make predictions about hearing loss-related changes in neural behaviour.</p> \n\n<p>One consequence of neurosensory hearing loss (noise-induced and aging-related) is a reduced ability to \nunderstand speech, particularly in noisy environments, and sometimes beyond what would be predicted from \nreduced audibility. Indeed, this type of speech deficit can occur in listeners with near-normal hearing \nthresholds [1]. A promising avenue of investigation to explain this comes from experimental results in mice \nshowing that there can be a permanent loss of auditory nerve fibres (ANFs) following \"temporary\" \nnoise-induced hearing loss (i.e. when thresholds return to normal after a few weeks) [2]. The downstream \nconsequences of this loss of fibres has not yet been systematically investigated (although see [3]). We \npredict, using a theoretical analysis that applies to a wide range of neural models, that the regularity of \nthe spike trains of many neurons in the cochlear nucleus (the next structure after the auditory nerve) will \ndecrease following a reduction in the number of input cells. </p>\n\n<p>We present a mathematical analysis of the stationary behaviour of \"chopper\" cells in the ventral cochlear \nnucleus, approximating them by a stochastic process that is entirely characterised by its mean, \nstandard deviation and time constants. Furthermore, these constants can be straightforwardly related to \nphysiologically significant parameters including the number of inputs and their average firing rates. From \nthis approximation, we can compute the regularity of the chopper cell spike trains measured as the \ncoefficient of variation of their interspike intervals (CV). </p>\n\n<p>One simple prediction of this model is that when the intensity of a stimulus changes, leading to a change in \nthe average firing rate of the ANF inputs, there will be a corresponding change in the regularity of the \nchopper cell spike train. This prediction poses problems for the widely used scheme for classifying chopper \ncells as sustained or transient based on their ongoing CVs as it implies that the classification could be \nlevel-dependent. We present a re-analysis of an existing experimental data set that demonstrates that ongoing \nCV is indeed level-dependent in the majority of chopper cells, and that in some cells (>7%) this leads to a \nlevel-dependence in their classification. </p>\n\n<p>Assuming a homeostatic regulation of long term firing rates, a loss of ANFs will lead to an increase in the \nstandard deviation of the stochastic process and a consequent increase in the CV of the chopper cell. Some \nchoppers that were previously classified as sustained will become transient, a substantial change in their \nbehaviour that is highly likely to disrupt auditory processing. While the function of chopper cells is still \ndebated, one suggested role is in the coding of temporal envelope [4], which is widely agreed to be essential \nfor understanding speech. Loss of ANFs could therefore lead to a disruption of the processing of temporal \nenvelope, and consequently degrade speech intelligibility. We briefly conclude by discussing the challenges \nof testing this hypothesis experimentally.</p>",

However, it is often challenging to apply existing third party models to own experimental paradigms, even if the model code is available. It will be demonstrated that model applicability is increased by providing a framework where the model acts as artificial observer performing exactly the same task as the subject (e.g., adaptive staircase procedure). A possible separation of the actual auditory processing of the model from the decision making stage will be discussed, which allows for testing the auditory processing of one model in a variety of experimental paradigms. The framework will consist of a citable data repository providing the required data for the models as well as toolboxes implementing both the auditory models and a variety of experimental paradigms. The model framework will be demonstrated with exemplary binaural models applied to the three most common binaural psychoacoustic paradigms: just noticeable difference (e.g., interaural time difference), tone in noise detection (e.g., binaural masking level difference), and absolute judgment (e.g., sound source localization). Further development of the framework will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "There are a number of detailed models of auditory neurons that are able to reproduce a wide range of phenomena. However, using these models to test hypotheses can be challenging, as they have many parameters and complex interacting subsystems. This makes it difficult to investigate the function of a mechanism by varying just one parameter in isolation, or to assess the robustness of a model by systematically varying many parameters. In some cases, by limiting the scope of a model to testing a specific hypothesis using a particular set of stimuli, it is possible to create a reduced mathematical model with relatively few, independent parameters. This has considerable advantages with respect to the problems above. In particular, if a certain behavior is robust and does not depend on finely tuned parameters, then different implementations are more likely to produce the same results—a key property for reproducible research. In addition, the code for these models is typically simpler and therefore more readable, and can often run faster, enabling us to carry out systematic parameter exploration. I will illustrate these points with a reduced model of chopper cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus."

Researchers will be invited to provide their established as well as newly developed models in whatever programming language they prefer, given the models are compatibility with the proposed interface to the testing software. This entails that the models act as artificial observers, testable with exactly the same procedure as the human subjects. A simple communication protocol based on wav and txt-files is proposed because these are supported by every programming environment, and are able connect models and testing software of any programming language.

It is not yet understood how such computations are performed in realistic acoustic environments where noise and reverberations are present. It has been hypothesized that robust sound localization is achieved through the extraction of the ITD information in the rising part of amplitude modulated (AM) sounds. Dietz et al. (2013) tested this hypothesis using psychoacoustics and MEG experiments. They presented AM sounds with ITDs varying during the course of one AM cycle. Their results showed that participants preferentially extracted the ITD information in the rising portion of the AM cycle. We designed a computational model of the auditory pathway to investigate the neural mechanisms involved in this process. Two mechanisms were tested. The first one corresponds to the adaptation in the auditory nerve fibers. The second mechanism occurs after coincidence detection and involves a winner-take-all network of ITD sensitive neurons. Both mechanisms qualitatively accounted for the data, consequently we suggest further experiments based on similar stimuli to distinguish between the two mechanisms. Dietz et al.

    "abstract": "Advances in experimental techniques and computational power allowing researchers to gather anatomical and\nelectrophysiological data at unprecedented levels of detail have fostered the development of increasingly complex\nmodels in computational neuroscience. Large-scale, biophysically detailed cell models pose a particular set of\ncomputational challenges, and this has led to the development of a number of domain-specific simulators. At the\nother level of detail, the ever growing variety of point neuron models increases the implementation barrier even\nfor those based on the relatively simple integrate-and-fire neuron model. Independently of the model complexity,\nall modeling methods crucially depend on an efficient and accurate transformation of mathematical model\ndescriptions into efficiently executable code. Neuroscientists usually publish model descriptions in terms of the\nmathematical equations underlying them. However, actually simulating them requires they be translated into code.\nThis can cause problems because errors may be introduced if this process is carried out by hand, and code written\nby neuroscientists may not be very computationally efficient. Furthermore, the translated code might be generated\nfor different hardware platforms, operating system variants or even written in different languages and thus\ncannot easily be combined or even compared. Two main approaches to addressing this issues have been followed. The\nfirst is to limit users to a fixed set of optimized models, which limits flexibility. The second is to allow\nmodel definitions in a high level interpreted language, although this may limit performance. Recently, a third\napproach has become increasingly popular: using code generation to automatically translate high level\ndescriptions into efficient low level code to combine the best of previous approaches. This approach also greatly\nenriches efforts to standardize simulator-independent model description languages. In the past few years, a\nnumber of code generation pipelines have been developed in the computational neuroscience community, which differ\nconsiderably in aim, scope and functionality. This article provides an overview of existing pipelines currently\nused within the community and contrasts their capabilities and the technologies and concepts behind them.",

Despite significant progress in the amount of detail and breadth covered by auditory models, for many\ncomponents of the auditory pathway there are still different model approaches that are often not equivalent but\nrather in conflict with each other. Similarly, some experimental studies yield conflicting results which has led\nto controversies. This can be best resolved by a systematic comparison of multiple experimental data sets and\nmodel approaches. Binaural processing is a prominent example of how the development of quantitative theories can\nadvance our understanding of the phenomena, but there remain several unresolved questions for which competing\nmodel approaches exist. This article discusses a number of current unresolved or disputed issues in binaural\nmodeling, as well as some of the significant challenges in comparing binaural models with each other and with the\nexperimental data. We introduce an auditory model framework, which we believe can become a useful infrastructure\nfor resolving some of the current controversies. It operates models over the same paradigms that are used\nexperimentally. The core of the proposed framework is an interface that connects three components irrespective of\ntheir underlying programming language: The experiment software, an auditory pathway model, and task-dependent\ndecision stages called artificial observers that provide the same output format as the test subject.",

    "abstract": "The auditory system processes temporal information at multiple scales, and disruptions to this temporal\nprocessing may lead to deficits in auditory tasks such as detecting and discriminating sounds in a noisy\nenvironment. Here, a modelling approach is used to study the temporal regularity of firing by chopper cells in\nthe ventral cochlear nucleus, in both the normal and impaired auditory system. Chopper cells, which have a\nstrikingly regular firing response, divide into two classes, sustained and transient, based on the time course of\nthis regularity. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the behaviour of chopper cells, and the\ndifference between sustained and transient cells in particular. However, there is no conclusive evidence so far.\nHere, a reduced mathematical model is developed and used to compare and test a wide range of hypotheses with a\nlimited number of parameters. Simulation results show a continuum of cell types and behaviours: chopper-like\nbehaviour arises for a wide range of parameters, suggesting that multiple mechanisms may underlie this behaviour.\nThe model accounts for systematic trends in regularity as a function of stimulus level that have previously only\nbeen reported anecdotally. Finally, the model is used to predict the effects of a reduction in the number of\nauditory nerve fibres (deafferentation due to, for example, cochlear synaptopathy).

    "abstract": "Delivery of immersive 3D audio with arbitrarily-positioned sound sources over headphones often requires processing of individual source signals through a set of Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs), the direction-dependent filters that describe the propagation of sound in an anechoic environment from the source to the listener's ears. The individual morphological differences and the impracticality of HRTF measurement make it difficult to deliver completely individualized 3D audio in this manner, and instead lead to the use of previously-measured non-individual sets of HRTFs. In this study a VR-based mobile sound localization training prototype system is introduced that uses HRTF sets for audio. It consists of a mobile phone as a head-mounted device, a hand-held Bluetooth controller, and a network-enabled PC with a USB audio interface and a pair of headphones. The virtual environment was developed on the mobile phone such that the user can listen-to/navigate-in an acoustically neutral scene and locate invisible target sound sources presented at random directions using non-individualized HRTFs in repetitive sessions. Various training paradigms can be designed with this system, with performance-related feedback provided according to the user's localization accuracy, including visual indication of the target location, and some aspects of a typical first-person shooting game, such as enemies, scoring, and level advancement. An experiment was conducted using this system in which 11 subjects went through multiple training sessions, using non-individualized HRTF sets. The localization performance evaluations showed reduction of overall localization angle error over repeated training sessions, reflecting lower front-back confusion rates."

In our daily life, however, we are exposed to rich auditory scenes with multiple sound sources and complementary visual information. Although it is understood that the presence of maskers hinders auditory spatial awareness, it is not known whether competing sound sources can provide spatial information that helps in localizing a target stimulus. In this study, we explore the effect of presenting controlled auditory scenes with different amounts of visual and spatial cues during a sound localization task. A novel, gamified localization task is also presented. Preliminary results suggest that subjects who are exposed to audio-visual anchors show faster improvements than those who are not."

The second option cannot describe all aspects of a computational experiment, such as the\npotentially complex logic of a stimulation protocol.

Generally they rely on emphasizing localization\ninformation at the onset of the incoming sound while discarding localization cues that arrive later. We modelled several\nof these mechanisms using neural circuits commonly found in the brain and tested their performance in the context of\nexperiments showing that, in the dominant frequency region for sound localisation, we have a preference for auditory cues\narriving during the rising slope of the sound energy (Dietz et al., 2013). We found that both single cell mechanisms (onset\nand adaptation) and population mechanisms (lateral inhibition) were easily able to reproduce the results across a very wide\nrange of parameter settings. This suggests that sound localization in reverberant environments may not require specialised\nmechanisms specific to perform that task, but could instead rely on common neural circuits in the brain. This would allow\nfor the possibility of individual differences in learnt strategies or neuronal parameters.

However, these stimuli often lack the characteristics of complex sounds such as speech. We propose an approach that combines neural modelling with machine learning to determine relevant low-level auditory features. Our approach bridges the gap between detailed neuronal models that capture specific auditory responses, and research on the statistics of real-world speech data and speech recognition. First, we introduce a feature detection model with a modest number of parameters that is compatible with auditory physiology. In order to objectively determine relevant feature detectors within the model parameter space, the model is tested in a speech classification task, using a simple classifier that approximates the information bottleneck. This framework allows us to determine the best model parameters and their neurophysiological and psychoacoustic implications. We show that our model can capture a variety of well-studied features (such as amplitude modulations and onsets) and allows us to unify concepts from different areas of hearing research. Our approach has various potential applications. Firstly, it could lead to new, testable experimental hypotheses for understanding hearing. Moreover, promising features could be directly applied as a new acoustic front-end for speech recognition systems."

In virtual audio systems, which aim to emulate these effects, non-individualized, generic HRTFs are typically used leading to an inaccurate perception of virtual sound location. Training has the potential to exploit the brain's ability to adapt to these unfamiliar cues. In this study, three virtual sound localization training paradigms were evaluated; one provided simple visual positional confirmation of sound source location, a second introduced game design elements (\"gamification\") and a final version additionally utilized head-tracking to provide listeners with experience of relative sound source motion (\"active listening\"). The results demonstrate a significant effect of training after a small number of short (12-minute) training sessions, which is retained across multiple days. Gamification alone had no significant effect on the efficacy of the training, but active listening resulted in a significantly greater improvements in localization accuracy. In general, improvements in virtual sound localization following training generalized to a second set of non-individualized HRTFs, although some HRTF-specific changes were observed in polar angle judgement for the active listening group. The implications of this on the putative mechanisms of the adaptation process are discussed."

    "abstract": "It is very common in studies of the learning capabilities of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to use homogeneous neural and synaptic parameters (time constants, thresholds, etc.). Even in studies in which these parameters are distributed heterogeneously, the advantages or disadvantages of the heterogeneity have rarely been studied in depth. By contrast, in the brain, neurons and synapses are highly diverse, leading naturally to the hypothesis that this heterogeneity may be advantageous for learning. Starting from two state-of-the-art methods for training spiking neural networks (Nicola & Clopath, 2017, Shrestha & Orchard 2018), we found that adding parameter heterogeneity reduced errors when the network had to learn more complex patterns, increased robustness to hyperparameter mistuning, and reduced the number of training iterations required. We propose that neural heterogeneity may be an important principle for brains to learn robustly in real world environments with highly complex structure, and where task-specific hyperparameter tuning may be impossible. Consequently, heterogeneity may also be a good candidate design principle for artificial neural networks, to reduce the need for expensive hyperparameter tuning as well as for reducing training time.

    "abstract": "Localizing sounds is an important ability for many species. However, reverberative sounds present a significant challenge to the auditory system as later arriving reverberations may carry confounding localization cues. The \"precedence effect\" refers to a set of perceptual behaviours related to this situation. Studies investigating the precedence effect observed that the auditory system tends to focus the core of the localization process on the computation of localization cues carried by the first arriving sound. Doing so relieves the auditory system from dealing with contradictory localization cues in later arriving sounds. A recent study by Dietz et al. (2013) confirmed that human listeners use this approach to deal with dynamic localization cues. In order to provide an explanation for this finding, we first tested several auditory models on the specific task described in Dietz et al. (2013) in order to shortlist possible mechanisms capable of accounting for the early extraction of temporal binaural cues. We found that the best candidates to account for this data are single cell mechanisms, such as adaptation and onset firing, as well as inhibitory population mechanisms. To further understand how each mechanism contributes to the suppression of lagging sounds, we designed more general models capable of demonstrating the principal features of each mechanism. We tested these models thoroughly and found that all mechanisms were able to reproduce the results over a wide range of parameters. This finding suggests that mechanisms responsible for the precedence effect may not be specialized to perform this specific task but instead may be the results of more commonly found neural circuits in the brain. Finally, to facilitate comparing the performance of auditory models on psychoacoustical data, we also designed and implemented an auditory modelling framework capable of addressing many challenges existing in the field of auditory modelling.",

    "abstract": "We introduce neural topic modelling - an unsupervised, scalable and interpretable neural data analysis tool which can be applied across different spatial and temporal scales. The aim is an approach that can handle the ever-increasing number of neurons recorded by high channel count multi-electrode arrays. Neural topic modelling is based on latent Dirichlet allocation, a method routinely used in text mining to find latent topics in texts. The spike trains are converted into \"neural words\" - the presence or absence of discrete events (e.g. neuron 1 has a higher firing rate than usual). Neural topic modelling results in a number of topics (probability distributions over words) which best explain the given co-occurrences of neural words over time. Applied to an electrophysiological dataset of mouse visual cortex, hippocampus and thalamus neurons, neural topic modelling groups neural words into topics which exhibit common attributes such as overlapping receptive fields or proximity on the recording electrode. It recovers these relationships despite receiving no knowledge about the cortex topography or about the spatial structure of the stimuli. Choosing neural activity patterns as neural words that are relevant to the brain makes the topics interpretable by both the brain and researchers, setting neural topic modelling apart from other machine learning approaches."

GeNN is a C++-based meta-compiler for accelerating spiking neural network simulations using consumer or high performance grade graphics processing units (GPUs). Here we introduce a new software package, Brian2GeNN, that connects the two systems so that users can make use of GeNN GPU acceleration when developing their models in Brian, without requiring any technical knowledge about GPUs, C++ or GeNN. The new Brian2GeNN software uses a pipeline of code generation to translate Brian scripts into C++ code that can be used as input to GeNN, and subsequently can be run on suitable NVIDIA GPU accelerators. From the user's perspective, the entire pipeline is invoked by adding two simple lines to their Brian scripts. We have shown that using Brian2GeNN, two non-trivial models from the literature can run tens to hundreds of times faster than on CPU.",

    "abstract": "Audio augmented reality (AAR) is defined as the extension of a real auditory environment through virtual sound sources. A successful AAR system should create the illusion that virtual sounds actually come from the user's environment, for which several technical challenges must be overcome. First, room acoustics must be simulated accurately to predict the reverberant sound field produced by the virtual source as sound wavefronts reach the user. Second, said sound field must be translated into a pair of sound pressure signals at the user's ears. Finally, this binaural signal must be delivered to the user through an acoustically transparent system without limiting their ability to hear real sources. This process should be able to adapt in real time to user movements in a computationally efficient way, considering that resources may be limited in practice and most of them will likely be allocated to graphics processing (e.g. in a pair of augmented reality glasses). This Thesis aims to improve current techniques for binaural audio rendering in AAR by exploring the trade-off between computational complexity and perceived quality. Several perception-focused studies were proposed to explore the different parts of the rendering process. First, a prototype AAR system with hear-through functionality was proposed and a pilot experiment was conducted to investigate how users could adapt to it over time. A second study assessed the effect of non-individualised equalisation on the perceived quality of binaural renderings reproduced with open-ear headphones. A third study evaluated several state-of-the-art methods for the binaural rendering of sound fields of limited resolution in the spherical harmonics (Ambisonics) domain. Finally, a fourth study assessed the perceptual effect of simplifying Ambisonics-based binaural reverberation in various ways. Even though this Thesis focuses on the AAR scenario, the findings herein may be helpful for any application that would benefit from a computationally efficient implementation of binaural audio rendering methods."

    "abstract": "The brain is a hugely diverse, heterogeneous structure. Whether or not heterogeneity at the neural level plays a functional role remains unclear, and has been relatively little explored in models which are often highly homogeneous. We compared the performance of spiking neural networks trained to carry out tasks of real-world difficulty, with varying degrees of heterogeneity, and found that heterogeneity substantially improved task performance. Learning with heterogeneity was more stable and robust, particularly for tasks with a rich temporal structure. In addition, the distribution of neuronal parameters in the trained networks is similar to those observed experimentally. We suggest that the heterogeneity observed in the brain may be more than just the byproduct of noisy processes, but rather may serve an active and important role in allowing animals to learn in changing environments.",

    "abstract": "Although pitch is closely related to temporal periodicity, stimuli with a degree of temporal irregularity can evoke a pitch sensation in human listeners. However, the neural mechanisms underlying pitch perception for irregular sounds are poorly understood. Here, we recorded responses of single units in the inferior colliculus (IC) of normal hearing (NH) rabbits to acoustic pulse trains with different amounts of random jitter in the inter-pulse intervals and compared with responses to electric pulse trains delivered through a cochlear implant (CI) in a different group of rabbits. In both NH and CI animals, many IC neurons demonstrated tuning of firing rate to the average pulse rate (APR) that was robust against temporal jitter, although jitter tended to increase the firing rates for APRs ≥ 1280 Hz. Strength and limiting frequency of spike synchronization to stimulus pulses were also comparable between periodic and irregular pulse trains, although there was a slight increase in synchronization at high APRs with CI stimulation. There were clear differences between CI and NH animals in both the range of APRs over which firing rate tuning was observed and the prevalence of synchronized responses. These results suggest that the pitches of regular and irregular pulse trains are coded differently by IC neurons depending on the APR, the degree of irregularity, and the mode of stimulation. In particular, the temporal pitch produced by periodic pulse trains lacking spectral cues may be based on a rate code rather than a temporal code at higher APRs."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning have instigated a renewed interest in using machine learning approaches to better understand human sensory processing. This line of research is particularly interesting for speech research since speech comprehension is uniquely human, which complicates obtaining detailed neural recordings. In this thesis, I explore how machine learning can be used to uncover new knowledge about the auditory system, with a focus on discovering robust auditory features. The resulting increased understanding of the noise robustness of human hearing may help to better assist those with hearing loss and improve Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. First, I show how computational neuroscience and machine learning can be combined to generate hypotheses about auditory features. I introduce a neural feature detection model with a modest number of parameters that is compatible with auditory physiology. By testing feature detector variants in a speech classification task, I confirm the importance of both well-studied and lesser-known auditory features. Second, I investigate whether ASR software is a good candidate model of the human auditory system. By comparing several state-of-the-art ASR systems to the results from humans on a range of psychometric experiments, I show that these ASR systems diverge markedly from humans in at least some psychometric tests. This implies that none of these systems act as a strong proxy for human speech recognition, although some may be useful when asking more narrowly defined questions. For neuroscientists, this thesis exemplifies how machine learning can be used to generate new hypotheses about human hearing, while also highlighting the caveats of investigating systems that may work fundamentally differently from the human brain. For machine learning engineers, I point to tangible directions for improving ASR systems. To motivate the continued cross-fertilization between these fields, a toolbox that allows researchers to assess new ASR systems has been released.",

This assessment\nwas supported by numerical analyses of HRTF interpolation errors, interaural differences,\nperceptually-relevant spectral differences, and loudness stability. Models predicted that the\nbinaural renderings’ accuracy increased with spatial order, as expected. A notable effect of the\npreprocessing method was observed: whereas all methods performed similarly at the highest spatial\norders, some were considerably better at lower orders. A newly proposed method, BiMagLS, displayed\nthe best performance overall and is recommended for the rendering of bilateral Ambisonics signals.\nThe results, which were in line with previous literature, indirectly validate the perceptual models’\nability to predict listeners’ responses in a consistent and explicable manner."

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have had considerable success in neuroscience as models of the visual system, and recent work has suggested this may also extend to the auditory system. We tested the behaviour of a range of state of the art deep learning-based automatic speech recognition systems on a wide collection of manipulated sounds used in standard human psychometric experiments. While some systems showed qualitative agreement with humans in certain tests, in others all tested systems diverged markedly from humans. In particular, all systems used spectral invariance, temporal fine structure and speech periodicity differently from humans. We conclude that despite some promising results, none of the tested automatic speech recognition systems can yet act as a strong proxy for human speech recognition. However, we note that the more recent systems with better performance also tend to better match human results, suggesting that continued cross-fertilisation of ideas between human and automatic speech recognition may be fruitful. Our open source toolbox allows researchers to assess future automatic speech recognition systems or add additional psychoacoustic measures.",

    "abstract": "This thesis focuses on the study of training deep spiking neural networks (SNNs). In recent years there has been an increasing interest in using spiking neurons for deep learning with the aim of leveraging their unique properties and characteristics. These include their potential for very energy efficient training and inference due to their highly sparse activity and their suitability to model biological neurons. We first introduce the fundamental models that are used in the SNN training literature, including neuron models at different levels of abstraction, synapses and networks of neurons and neurons under noise. We also review the main SNN training methods that have been developed to this date. Then, we study the role of neural heterogeneity and study the performance and robustness of SNNs under different heterogeneity schemes on two different supervised learning methods. Next, we show how the sparse activity present in the forward pass on SNNs can also be achieved in the backward pass, leading to highly efficient implementations that can speed up the backward pass up to 150x and save 85% of the memory. Finally, we aim to solve the weight initialisation problem for SNNs to achieve a predictable network activity as well as prevent the gradient from vanishing or exploding. In this process, we identify and solve the firing rate collapse issue caused by the discretisation of SNNs for simulation. In addition, we obtain theoretical and empirical results for a general SNN initialisation strategy making use of variance propagation and diffusion/shot-noise/threshold integration methods, as well as the solution to the firing rate collapse problem we previously found. Besides the ideas and experiments discussed in this thesis, code for the methods described here can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/npvoid\">https://github.com/npvoid</a>."

However, it is still unclear\nwhat constitutes a good initialisation for an SNN. We often use initialisation schemes developed for ANN\ntraining which are often inadequate and require manual tuning. In this paper, we attempt to tackle this\nissue by using techniques from the ANN initialisation literature as well as computational neuroscience\nresults. We show that the problem of weight initialisation for ANNs is a more nuanced problem than it is\nfor ANNs due to the spike-and-reset non-linearity of SNNs and the firing rate collapse problem. We firstly\nidentify and propose several solutions to the firing rate collapse problem under different sets of\nassumptions which successfully solve the issue by leveraging classical random walk and Wiener processes\nresults. Secondly, we devise a general strategy for SNN initialisation which combines variance propagation\ntechniques from ANNs and different methods to obtain the expected firing rate and membrane potential\ndistribution based on diffusion and shot-noise approximations. Altogether, we obtain theoretical results\nto solve the SNN initialisation which consider the membrane potential distribution in the presence of a\nthreshold. Yet, to what extent can these methods be successfully applied to SNNs on real datasets remains\nan open question. "

    "abstract": "Brains have evolved diverse neurons with varying morphologies and dynamics that impact temporal information processing. In contrast, most neural network models use homogeneous units that vary only in spatial parameters (weights and biases). To explore the importance of temporal parameters, we trained spiking neural networks on tasks with varying temporal complexity, holding different parameter subsets constant. We found that adapting conduction delays is crucial for solving all test conditions under tight resource constraints. Remarkably, these tasks can be solved using only temporal parameters (delays and time constants) with constant weights. In more complex spatio-temporal tasks, an adaptable bursting parameter was essential. Overall, allowing adaptation of both temporal and spatial parameters enhances network robustness to noise, a vital feature for biological brains and neuromorphic computing systems. Our findings suggest that rich and adaptable dynamics may be the key for solving temporally structured tasks efficiently in evolving organisms, which would help explain the diverse physiological properties of biological neurons."

    "abstract": "Animals continuously detect information via multiple sensory channels, like vision and hearing, and integrate these signals to realise faster and more accurate decisions; a fundamental neural computation known as multisensory integration. A widespread view of this process is that multimodal neurons linearly fuse information across sensory channels. However, does linear fusion generalise beyond the classical tasks used to explore multisensory integration? Here, we develop novel multisensory tasks, which focus on the underlying statistical relationships between channels, and deploy models at three levels of abstraction: from probabilistic ideal observers to artificial and spiking neural networks. Using these models, we demonstrate that when the information provided by different channels is not independent, linear fusion performs sub-optimally and even fails in extreme cases. This leads us to propose a simple nonlinear algorithm for multisensory integration which is compatible with our current knowledge of multimodal circuits, excels in naturalistic settings and is optimal for a wide class of multisensory tasks. Thus, our work emphasises the role of nonlinear fusion in multisensory integration, and provides testable hypotheses for the field to explore at multiple levels: from single neurons to behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscientists are increasingly initiating large-scale collaborations which bring together tens to hundreds of researchers. At this scale, such projects can tackle large-scale challenges and engage a wide range of participants. Inspired by projects in pure mathematics, we set out to test the feasibility of widening access to such projects even further, by running a massively collaborative project in computational neuroscience. The key difference, with prior neuroscientific efforts, being that our entire project (code, results, writing) was public from the outset, and that anyone could participate. To achieve this, we launched a public Git repository, with code for training spiking neural networks to solve a sound localisation task via surrogate gradient descent. We then invited anyone, anywhere to use this code as a springboard for exploring questions of interest to them, and encouraged participants to share their work both asynchronously through Git and synchronously at monthly online workshops. Our hope was that the resulting range of participants would allow us to make discoveries that a single team would have been unlikely to find. At a scientific level, our work investigated how a range of biologically-relevant parameters, from time delays to membrane time constants and levels of inhibition, could impact sound localisation in networks of spiking units. At a more macro-level, our project brought together 31 researchers from multiple countries, provided hands-on research experience to early career participants, and opportunities for supervision and teaching to later career participants. While our scientific results were not groundbreaking, our project demonstrates the potential for massively collaborative projects to transform neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Animals continuously combine information across sensory modalities and time, and use these combined signals to guide their behaviour. Picture a predator watching their prey sprint and screech through a field. To date, a range of multisensory algorithms have been proposed to model this process including linear and nonlinear fusion, which combine the inputs from multiple sensory channels via either a sum or nonlinear function. However, many multisensory algorithms treat successive observations independently, and so cannot leverage the temporal structure inherent to naturalistic stimuli. To investigate this, we introduce a novel multisensory task in which we provide the same number of task-relevant signals per trial but vary how this information is presented: from many short bursts to a few long sequences. We demonstrate that multisensory algorithms that treat different time steps as independent, perform sub-optimally on this task. However, simply augmenting these algorithms to integrate across sensory channels and short temporal windows allows them to perform surprisingly well, and comparably to fully recurrent neural networks. Overall, our work: highlights the benefits of fusing multisensory information across channels and time, shows that small increases in circuit/model complexity can lead to significant gains in performance, and provides a novel multisensory task for testing the relevance of this in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Cellular automata have long been celebrated for their ability to generate complex behaviors from simple, local rules, with well-known discrete models like Conway's Game of Life proven capable of universal computation. Recent advancements have extended cellular automata into continuous domains, raising the question of whether these systems retain the capacity for universal computation. In parallel, neural cellular automata have emerged as a powerful paradigm where rules are learned via gradient descent rather than manually designed. This work explores the potential of neural cellular automata to develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automaton through training by gradient descent. We introduce a cellular automaton model, objective functions and training strategies to guide neural cellular automata toward universal computation in a continuous setting. Our experiments demonstrate the successful training of fundamental computational primitives - such as matrix multiplication and transposition - culminating in the emulation of a neural network solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within the cellular automata state. These results represent a foundational step toward realizing analog general-purpose computers, with implications for understanding universal computation in continuous dynamics and advancing the automated discovery of complex cellular automata behaviors via machine learning.

    "abstract": "The brain is structurally and functionally modular, although recent evidence has raised questions about the extent of both types of modularity. Using a simple, toy artificial neural network setup that allows for precise control, we find that structural modularity does not in general guarantee functional specialization (across multiple measures of specialization). Further, in this setup (1) specialization only emerges when features of the environment are meaningfully separable, (2) specialization preferentially emerges when the network is strongly resource-constrained, and (3) these findings are qualitatively similar across several different variations of network architectures. Finally, we show that functional specialization varies dynamically across time, and these dynamics depend on both the timing and bandwidth of information flow in the network. We conclude that a static notion of specialization is likely too simple a framework for understanding intelligence in situations of real-world complexity, from biology to brain-inspired neuromorphic systems.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the extent to which Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained with Surrogate Gradient Descent (Surrogate GD), with and without delay learning, can learn from precise spike timing beyond firing rates. We first design synthetic tasks isolating intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and cross-neuron synchrony under matched spike counts. On more complex spike-based speech recognition datasets (Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), we construct variants where spike count information is eliminated and only timing information remains, and show that Surrogate GD-trained SNNs are able to perform significantly above chance whereas purely rate-based models perform at chance level. We further evaluate robustness under biologically inspired perturbations -- including Gaussian jitter per spike or per-neuron, and spike deletion -- revealing consistent but perturbation-specific degradation. Networks show a sharp performance drop when spike sequences are reversed in time, with a larger drop in performance from SNNs trained with delays, indicating that these networks are more human-like in terms of behaviour. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have released our modified SHD and SSC datasets.",

    "abstract": "The acoustic cues used by humans and other animals to localise sounds are subtle, and change during and after development. This means that we need to constantly relearn or recalibrate the auditory spatial map throughout our lifetimes. This is often thought of as a \"supervised\" learning process where a \"teacher\" (for example, a parent, or your visual system) tells you whether or not you guessed the location correctly, and you use this information to update your map. However, there is not always an obvious teacher (for example in babies or blind people). Using computational models, we showed that approximate feedback from a simple innate circuit, such as that can distinguish left from right (e.g. the auditory orienting response), is sufficient to learn an accurate full-range spatial auditory map. Moreover, using this mechanism in addition to supervised learning can more robustly maintain the adaptive neural representation. We find several possible neural mechanisms that could underlie this type of learning, and hypothesise that multiple mechanisms may be present and interact with each other. We conclude that when studying spatial hearing, we should not assume that the only source of learning is from the visual system or other supervisory signal. Further study of the proposed mechanisms could allow us to design better rehabilitation programmes to accelerate relearning/recalibration of spatial maps.",

    "abstract": "Neuromodulators allow circuits to dynamically change their biophysical properties in a context-sensitive way. In addition to their role in learning, neuromodulators have been suggested to play a role in sensory processing at relatively fast timescales (less than a second), although the precise mechanisms at play are still not well understood. To assess the potential computational role of neuromodulators in sensory processing, we added a simple but flexible model of neuromodulation to spiking neural networks. These networks were then trained - with methods from machine learning - to carry out challenging sensory processing tasks. We find that this addition leads to a dramatic improvement in sensory processing in every task and configuration we tested. In particular, we find that without explicitly training for this, it decreases reaction times, a role that has been discussed for the cholinergic system. In a particularly challenging speech recognition in noise task, we find that the networks learn to make use of rapid dynamic gain control via excitability, an attentional mechanism akin to the “listening in the dips” strategy. This has been hypothesised to be a key element of human hearing allowing us to perform better in these conditions than even state-of-the-art machine learning systems. We conclude that neuromodulation does have the potential to play a significant computational role in fast sensory processing. In addition, our neuromodulated spiking neural networks are able to substantially increase performance at only a small cost to computational complexity, and may therefore be valuable for applications in energy-efficient “neuromorphic” computing devices.\n",

    "abstract": "Neural circuits are sparse and bidirectional. Meaning that signals flow from early sensory areas to later regions and back. Yet, between connected areas there exist some but not all pathways. How does this structure, somewhere between feedforward and fully recurrent, shape circuit function? To address this question, we designed a new recurrent neural network model in which a set of weight matrices (i.e. pathways) can be combined to generate every network structure between feedforward and fully recurrent. We term these architectures partially recurrent neural networks (pRNNs). We trained over 25,000 pRNNs on a novel set of reinforcement learning tasks, designed to mimic multisensory navigation, and compared their performance across multiple functional metrics. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, many architectures match or exceed the performance of fully recurrent networks, despite using as few as one-quarter the number of parameters; demonstrating that partial recurrence enables energy efficient, yet performant solutions. Second, each pathway’s functional impact is both task and circuit dependent. For instance, feedback connections enhance robustness to noise in some, but not all contexts. Third, different pRNN architectures learn solutions with distinct input sensitivities and memory dynamics, and these computational traits help to explain their functional capabilities. Overall, our results demonstrate that partial recurrence enables robust and efficient computation - a finding that helps to explain why neural circuits are sparse and bidirectional, and how these principles could inform the design of artificial systems.\n",
