<h2>Openings</h2>

<h3>PhD</h3>

<p>
I am interested in supervising students with a strong mathematical, computational or neuroscience
background. Projects could be carried out in several possible areas relating to the
<a href="index.html">work in the group</a>. You might be interested in doing some
<a href="comp-neuro-resources.html"> general reading on computational neuroscience</a>. Some suggestions for topics
that would be interesting to me are below, but I'm very happy to consider
other possibilities. 
In addition to working within the group, studying at Imperial College provides excellent
opportunities for interacting with other theoretical and experimental researchers, both at
Imperial and in the many  neuroscience groups in London.
</p>

<p>
Applicants for a PhD position should initially
<a href="https://imperial.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e4jixR7Z9VPcJbD">fill out the
pre-submission enquiry form</a>, and will eventually have to formally
apply through the standard Imperial College mechanism (for more information, see
<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/study/phd/">here</a>).
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    <b>Note on Brexit.</b> EU students starting a PhD in 2020-21 will still have the right to study in the UK, and be
    eligible for UK fee status and for financial support for the full duration of their course. See the
    <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/imperial-and-the-european-union/support-for-students/">Imperial College
    Brexit FAQ</a> for more details. The last opportunity for a funded place starting in the 2020-21 academic
    year will be a funding panel to take place in October 2020, so EU candidates should get applications in as soon
    as possible, and please include a note in your email to me to make clear you are an EU candidate.
</div>

<p>
    <b>Entry requirements.</b> A masters degree is required for PhD study at Imperial: please see the
    <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/requirements/">PhD requirements</a> page
    (and the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/apply/requirements/pgacademic/">Country-specific
    requirements</a>). Note that funding is competitive and usually requires grades substantially higher than the
    minimum requirements (see below).
</p>

<p>
    <b>Funding.</b> Most students are funded by Imperial. Funding is assessed competitively at a panel that meets every
    few months. Normally an undergraduate or masters qualification at an equivalent level to a UK 1st or Distinction is
    required, but a lower grade may be possible if you already have publications or other experience.
    You can get a rough idea of UK equivalency
    <a href="https://www.grb.uk.com/recruiter-research/international-degree-equivalents">here</a> (although this is
    not guaranteed to be accurate).
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-degree-equivalency-table-and-methodology">This
    document</a> has been withdrawn but gives slightly more detail of these equivalencies for many countries. There are
    other options for funding including the China Scholarship Council. For more information about funding options,
    see <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/study/phd/funding-and-scholarships/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Supervision style.</b> It's important to select a PhD supervisor who you can work well with. My approach to
    PhD supervision is as follows. Students' projects are their own. I'm happy to make suggestions of things I find
    interesting and provide guidance, but I won't tell you exactly what to do. I would expect to see you on average
    around one hour per week, and this can either be at a regular time or arranged ad hoc. We have a weekly two hour
    lab meeting, lunch plus one hour doing either a journal club, tutorials, or presenting early stage research
    results for feedback. I would encourage you to get in touch with one of my current PhD students (see the list
    <a href="members.html">here</a>) to have an informal chat about life in the group and at Imperial.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Interview format.</b> Interviews are with me and one other faculty 
    member at Imperial, and typically last around one hour. We will send you a
    paper to read a week in advance, and ask you to summarise and discuss it
    in the interview. We will normally ask you to talk about previous project
    work, and what you would like to work on (in broad terms) during your PhD.
    We will not ask you to solve puzzles or problems. You will have an
    opportunity to ask us questions, and we will also put you in touch with
    one of our current PhD students to chat to in confidence.
</p>

<h3>Postdoctoral</h3>

<p>
I do not currently have any open postdoctoral positions, but please get in touch
if you are interested in applying for your own funding through a fellowship
scheme, for example. 
</p>

<h2>Themes and suggested topics</h2>

<p>
    I am particularly interested at the moment in applying methods from machine
    learning to models with a more biological flavour than the artificial neural
    networks typically studied in machine learning. This could include neurons
    with temporal dynamics, spiking neurons, etc. The aim is to use
    machine learning methods to find biologically relevant insights. To get a
    feel for this sort of work, you might be interested in seeing some of the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SrEycIbfRE&list=PL09WqqDbQWHFvM9DFYkM_GfnrVnIdLRhy">recorded
    talks</a> from a recent <a href="https://neural-reckoning.github.io/snn_workshop_2020/">workshop
    I organised</a>.
</p>

<p>
    With that said, all of the topics below are interesting to me, and if one of these
    suggestions particularly resonates with you, the most rewarding for me is
    always to work with someone on a topic they also find exciting.
</p>

<h3>Machine learning and neuroscience</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Hypothesis generation.</i> The unique quality of the brain is its ability
        to solve complex tasks in difficult environments. Modern machine learning
        enables us for the first time to design models that can perform comparably to
        the brain. Can we use techniques from machine learning combined with our
        limited knowledge of the structure of the brain to suggest hypotheses for the
        computational roles of neural components?
        <br/><a href="pub_data_driven_auditory_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Brain-inspired architectures.</i> One of the most successful machine
        learning techniques in recent years is the convolutional neural network
        which is inspired by the structure of the visual system. Can we find other
        powerful architectures inspired by different areas of the brain?
        <br/><a href="pub_attention_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Machine listening.</i> There has been incredibly successful work in
        visual recognition using machine learning, but the auditory equivalent is
        relatively less well studied.
        <br/><a href="pub_data_driven_auditory_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Robustness.</i> Machine learning techniques such as deep networks are
        often not robust in the same way as the brain (for example,
        <a href="https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/">adversarial images</a>).
        Can we design more robust machine learning techniques inspired by the brain?
        <br/><a href="pub_heterogeneity_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication 1]</a>
        <a href="pub_attention_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication 2]</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Neural processing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Spiking neurons.</i> Implementing functional networks using
        spiking neurons. Investigating the advantages of disadvantages
        of spiking versus artificial neurons. Are there computations that
        fundamentally require spiking neurons?
        <br/><a href="pub_spike_timing_sound_loc.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Heterogeneity.</i> There is a great deal of theory on
        homogeneous networks of neurons, but heterogeneity (of neuron
        properties for example) may be functionally important.
        <br/><a href="pub_heterogeneity_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Temporal processing.</i> The brain has to process a continuous
        stream of sensory information which can arrive at unexpected times and
        may need to be rapidly processed. The temporal structure of the
        input at fast timescales may be important (particularly in the
        auditory system).
        <br/><a href="pub_spike_timing_sound_loc.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Multiplexing.</i> Model neurons or networks usually address only a
        single task, however in the brain it appears neurons are involved
        in multiple computations simultaneously and may multiplex information
        or computations.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Auditory and other sensory systems</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Sound localisation.</i> Few models of sound localisation are able
        to handle the complexity of real acoustic environments, with
        multiple sources, background noise, reverberation, etc.
        <br/><a href="pub_decoding_soundloc.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Auditory scene analysis and the cocktail party problem.</i> How
        do we separate out multiple sound sources and either listen to them
        all or focus on a single one? This is very relevant to the problem of
        speech recognition in the presence of background noise or multiple
        speakers, which is an unsolved problem.
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Binding.</i> How do we group multiple features (auditory or across
        modalities) into underlying objects?
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Simulation and data analysis</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Neural simulation.</i> I'm always interested in work on techniques
        for neural simulation, and encourage anyone who works with me to contribute
        to the <a href="http://briansimulator.org/">Brian simulator</a>.
        <br/><a href="pub_brian2.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Analysing large scale neural data.</i>
        New experimental techniques are becoming available which provide several
        orders of magnitude more data than were previously available, but there is not yet
        agreement on methods for using this data to understand how the brain functions.
        <br/><a href="pub_neural_topic_modelling_ccn2019.html">[Sample publication]</a>
    </li>
</ul>
