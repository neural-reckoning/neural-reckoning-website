        <div><b>Abstract.</b> 
       Auditory research has a rich history of combining experimental evidence with computational simulations of
       auditory processing in order to deepen our theoretical understanding of how sound is processed in the ears and in
       the brain. Despite significant progress in the amount of detail and breadth covered by auditory models, for many
       components of the auditory pathway there are still different model approaches that are often not equivalent but
       rather in conflict with each other. Similarly, some experimental studies yield conflicting results which has led
       to controversies. This can be best resolved by a systematic comparison of multiple experimental data sets and
       model approaches. Binaural processing is a prominent example of how the development of quantitative theories can
       advance our understanding of the phenomena, but there remain several unresolved questions for which competing
       model approaches exist. This article discusses a number of current unresolved or disputed issues in binaural
       modeling, as well as some of the significant challenges in comparing binaural models with each other and with the
       experimental data. We introduce an auditory model framework, which we believe can become a useful infrastructure
       for resolving some of the current controversies. It operates models over the same paradigms that are used
       experimentally. The core of the proposed framework is an interface that connects three components irrespective of
       their underlying programming language: The experiment software, an auditory pathway model, and task-dependent
       decision stages called artificial observers that provide the same output format as the test subject.
