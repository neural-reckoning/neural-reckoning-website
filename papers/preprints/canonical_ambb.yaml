abstract: |-
  Sound localization in reverberant environments is a difficult task that human listeners perform effortlessly.
  Many neural mechanisms have been proposed to account for this behavior. Generally they rely on emphasizing localization
  information at the onset of the incoming sound while discarding localization cues that arrive later. We modelled several
  of these mechanisms using neural circuits commonly found in the brain and tested their performance in the context of
  experiments showing that, in the dominant frequency region for sound localisation, we have a preference for auditory cues
  arriving during the rising slope of the sound energy (Dietz et al., 2013). We found that both single cell mechanisms (onset
  and adaptation) and population mechanisms (lateral inhibition) were easily able to reproduce the results across a very wide
  range of parameter settings. This suggests that sound localization in reverberant environments may not require specialised
  mechanisms specific to perform that task, but could instead rely on common neural circuits in the brain. This would allow
  for the possibility of individual differences in learnt strategies or neuronal parameters. This research is fully
  reproducible, and we made our code available to edit and run online via interactive live notebooks.
