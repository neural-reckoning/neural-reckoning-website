abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) software has been suggested as a candidate
  model of the human auditory system thanks to dramatic improvements in performance
  in recent years. To test this hypothesis, we compared several state-of-the-art ASR
  systems to results from humans on a barrage of standard psychoacoustic experiments.
  While some systems showed qualitative agreement with humans in some tests, in others
  all tested systems diverged markedly from humans. In particular, none of the models
  used spectral invariance, temporal fine structure or speech periodicity in a similar
  way to humans. We conclude that none of the tested ASR systems are yet ready to
  act as a strong proxy for human speech recognition. However, we note that the more
  recent systems with better performance also tend to better match human results,
  suggesting that continued cross-fertilisation of ideas between human and automatic
  speech recognition may be fruitful. Our software is released as an open-source toolbox
  to allow researchers to assess future ASR systems or add additional psychoacoustic
  measures.
