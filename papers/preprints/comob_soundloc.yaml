abstract: Neuroscientists are increasingly initiating large-scale collaborations which bring together tens to hundreds of researchers. However, while these projects represent a step-change in scale, they retain a traditional structure with centralised funding, participating laboratories and data sharing on publication. Inspired by an open-source project in pure mathematics, we set out to test the feasibility of an alternative structure by running a grassroots, massively collaborative project in computational neuroscience. To do so, we launched a public Git repository, with code for training spiking neural networks to solve a sound localisation task via surrogate gradient descent. We then invited anyone, anywhere to use this code as a springboard for exploring questions of interest to them, and encouraged participants to share their work both asynchronously through Git and synchronously at monthly online workshops. At a scientific level, our work investigated how a range of biologically-relevant parameters, from time delays to membrane time constants and levels of inhibition, could impact sound localisation in networks of spiking units. At a more macro-level, our project brought together 31 researchers from multiple countries, provided hands-on research experience to early career participants, and opportunities for supervision and teaching to later career participants. Looking ahead, our project provides a glimpse of what open, collaborative science could look like and provides a necessary, tentative step towards it.
