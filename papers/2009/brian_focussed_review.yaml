abstract: "\"Brian\" is a simulator for spiking neural networks\n(http://www.briansimulator.org\
  \ ). The focus is on making the writing of\nsimulation code as quick and easy as\
  \ possible for the user, and on\nflexibility: new and non-standard models are no\
  \ more difficult to define\nthan standard ones. This allows scientists to spend\
  \ more time on the\ndetails of their models, and less on their implementation. Neuron\
  \ models\nare defined by writing differential equations in standard mathematical\n\
  notation, facilitating scientific communication. Brian is written in the\nPython\
  \ programming language, and uses vector-based computation to allow\nfor efficient\
  \ simulations. It is particularly useful for neuroscientific\nmodelling at the systems\
  \ level, and for teaching computational\nneuroscience. "
