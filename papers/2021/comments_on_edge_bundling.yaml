abstract: |-
  Bach et al. [1] recently presented an algorithm for constructing confluent drawings, by leveraging power graph
  decomposition to generate an auxiliary routing graph. We identify two problems with their method and offer a
  single solution to solve both. We also classify the exact type of confluent drawings that the algorithm can
  produce as 'power-confluent', and prove that it is a subclass of the previously studied 'strict confluent'
  drawing. A description and source code of our implementation is also provided, which additionally includes an
  improved method for power graph construction.
