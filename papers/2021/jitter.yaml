abstract: Although pitch is closely related to temporal periodicity, stimuli with
  a degree of temporal irregularity can evoke a pitch sensation in human listeners.
  However, the neural mechanisms underlying pitch perception for irregular sounds
  are poorly understood. Here, we recorded responses of single units in the inferior
  colliculus (IC) of normal hearing (NH) rabbits to acoustic pulse trains with different
  amounts of random jitter in the inter-pulse intervals and compared with responses
  to electric pulse trains delivered through a cochlear implant (CI) in a different
  group of rabbits. In both NH and CI animals, many IC neurons demonstrated tuning
  of firing rate to the average pulse rate (APR) that was robust against temporal
  jitter, although jitter tended to increase the firing rates for APRs ≥ 1280 Hz.
  Strength and limiting frequency of spike synchronization to stimulus pulses were
  also comparable between periodic and irregular pulse trains, although there was
  a slight increase in synchronization at high APRs with CI stimulation. There were
  clear differences between CI and NH animals in both the range of APRs over which
  firing rate tuning was observed and the prevalence of synchronized responses. These
  results suggest that the pitches of regular and irregular pulse trains are coded
  differently by IC neurons depending on the APR, the degree of irregularity, and
  the mode of stimulation. In particular, the temporal pitch produced by periodic
  pulse trains lacking spectral cues may be based on a rate code rather than a temporal
  code at higher APRs.
