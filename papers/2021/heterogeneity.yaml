abstract: The brain is a hugely diverse, heterogeneous structure. Whether or not heterogeneity
  at the neural level plays a functional role remains unclear, and has been relatively
  little explored in models which are often highly homogeneous. We compared the performance
  of spiking neural networks trained to carry out tasks of real-world difficulty,
  with varying degrees of heterogeneity, and found that heterogeneity substantially
  improved task performance. Learning with heterogeneity was more stable and robust,
  particularly for tasks with a rich temporal structure. In addition, the distribution
  of neuronal parameters in the trained networks is similar to those observed experimentally.
  We suggest that the heterogeneity observed in the brain may be more than just the
  byproduct of noisy processes, but rather may serve an active and important role
  in allowing animals to learn in changing environments.
