abstract: |-
  Legacy conferences are costly, time-consuming, and exclude scientists lacking various resources
  or abilities. During the 2020 pandemic, we created an online conference platform, Neuromatch
  Conferences, aimed at developing technological and cultural changes to make conferences more
  democratic, scalable, and accessible. We discuss the lessons we learned.
