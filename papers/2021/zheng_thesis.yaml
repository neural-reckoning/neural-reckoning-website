  This thesis concerns the visualisation of networks, through an in-depth study into
  the node-link diagram representation. Three subtopics are explored within this
  space. The first is the problem of node layout, where the optimisation of a popular
  energy function, known as stress, is improved through an algorithm known
  as stochastic gradient descent. The second is the method of edge bundling, where
  the idea of hierarchical edge bundling is explored in the absence of a known ground
  truth hierarchy. Its similarity to a topologically lossless bundling method known
  as power-confluent drawing is then leveraged, in order to improve technical problems
  with the underlying algorithms. The final topic is an engineering application
  in the form of a serious game called EcoBuilder, which utilises the node-link diagram
  to visualise the dynamical behaviour of food webs. Its purpose is to crowdsource
  research through a citizen science approach, with outcomes in both visualisation
  and mathematical ecology.
