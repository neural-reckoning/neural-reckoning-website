abstract: |-
  <p>Recent progress in recording techniques now allows researchers to record
  from hundreds and even thousands of neurons simultaneously. New, scalable
  methods need to be developed to handle such large data sets. Ideally
  these methods should not only analyse the multi-dimensional data, but also
  provide results which could be interpreted by the brain.</p>

  <p>One key problem in neuronal data analysis is to identify neuronal assemblies
  i.e. groups of neurons displaying coordinated neuronal activity. Currently
  available methods either search for assemblies whose neurons participate
  in repeated spike sequences or search for assemblies whose neurons display
  similar firing rate modulations. In this thesis, I present two approaches
  to the search for neuronal assemblies.</p>

  <p>I investigate whether a spiking neural network equipped with biologically
  plausible synaptic learning rules can provide a biologically interpretable way
  of finding repeating spike patterns in neuronal data. Due to the similarities
  between spiking neural networks to how brains function, this might be very
  close to how the brain itself detects such repeated activity.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, I present neural topic modelling â€“ a new data analysis method
  for large neuronal data sets. Based on a machine learning method from text
  mining, neural topic modelling is scalable and produces interpretable results.
  By including multiple features of neuronal spike trains and even other
  data types such as local field potentials into the analysis, I can expand the
  definition of neuronal assemblies to any type of neuronal activity features
  which are co-modulated. The application of neural topic modelling to neuronal
  recordings reveals interactions between features of neuronal activity
  which have previously not been identified.</p>

  <p>Since both approaches are biologically plausible, the results from both
  methods can be used to generate hypotheses about how the brain processes
  information and may reveal hitherto unknown information processing pathways.</p>
