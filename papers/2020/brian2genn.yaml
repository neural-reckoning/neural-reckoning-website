abstract: '"Brian" is a popular Python-based simulator for spiking neural networks,
  commonly used in computational neuroscience. GeNN is a C++-based meta-compiler for
  accelerating spiking neural network simulations using consumer or high performance
  grade graphics processing units (GPUs). Here we introduce a new software package,
  Brian2GeNN, that connects the two systems so that users can make use of GeNN GPU
  acceleration when developing their models in Brian, without requiring any technical
  knowledge about GPUs, C++ or GeNN. The new Brian2GeNN software uses a pipeline of
  code generation to translate Brian scripts into C++ code that can be used as input
  to GeNN, and subsequently can be run on suitable NVIDIA GPU accelerators. From the
  user''s perspective, the entire pipeline is invoked by adding two simple lines to
  their Brian scripts. We have shown that using Brian2GeNN, two non-trivial models
  from the literature can run tens to hundreds of times faster than on CPU.'
