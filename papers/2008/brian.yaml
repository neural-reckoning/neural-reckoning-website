abstract: "\"Brian\" is a new simulator for spiking neural networks, written in\n\
  Python (http://www.briansimulator.org ). It is an intuitive and highly\nflexible\
  \ tool for rapidly developing new models, especially networks of\nsingle-compartment\
  \ neurons. In addition to using standard types of\nneuron models, users can define\
  \ models by writing arbitrary differential\nequations in ordinary mathematical notation.\
  \ Python scientific libraries\ncan also be used for defining models and analysing\
  \ data. Vectorisation\ntechniques allow efficient simulations despite the overheads\
  \ of an\ninterpreted language. Brian will be especially valuable for working on\n\
  non-standard neuron models not easily covered by existing software, and\nas an alternative\
  \ to using Matlab or C for simulations. With its easy\nand intuitive syntax, Brian\
  \ is also very well suited for teaching\ncomputational neuroscience. "
