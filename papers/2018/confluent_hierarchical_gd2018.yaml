abstract: "Recently an edge bundling technique known as confluent\x02* drawing was\
  \ applied to general graphs by Bach et al. (2017) by leveraging power graph decomposition\
  \ (a form of edge compression that groups similar vertices together, merging edges\
  \ shared among group members). We explore the technique further by demonstrating\
  \ the equivalence between confluent drawing and the hierarchical edge bundling of\
  \ Holten (2006), thereby opening the door for existing hierarchical clustering algorithms\
  \ to be used instead of power graphs to produce confluent drawings for general graphs.\
  \ We investigate various popular hierarchical clustering methods, and present a\
  \ qualitative experimental comparison between them. We also introduce a new distance\
  \ measure for agglomerative clustering that outperforms previous measures, and make\
  \ recommendations for using the method in practice."
