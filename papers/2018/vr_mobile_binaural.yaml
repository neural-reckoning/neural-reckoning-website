abstract: Delivery of immersive 3D audio with arbitrarily-positioned sound sources
  over headphones often requires processing of individual source signals through a
  set of Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs), the direction-dependent filters
  that describe the propagation of sound in an anechoic environment from the source
  to the listener's ears. The individual morphological differences and the impracticality
  of HRTF measurement make it difficult to deliver completely individualized 3D audio
  in this manner, and instead lead to the use of previously-measured non-individual
  sets of HRTFs. In this study a VR-based mobile sound localization training prototype
  system is introduced that uses HRTF sets for audio. It consists of a mobile phone
  as a head-mounted device, a hand-held Bluetooth controller, and a network-enabled
  PC with a USB audio interface and a pair of headphones. The virtual environment
  was developed on the mobile phone such that the user can listen-to/navigate-in an
  acoustically neutral scene and locate invisible target sound sources presented at
  random directions using non-individualized HRTFs in repetitive sessions. Various
  training paradigms can be designed with this system, with performance-related feedback
  provided according to the user's localization accuracy, including visual indication
  of the target location, and some aspects of a typical first-person shooting game,
  such as enemies, scoring, and level advancement. An experiment was conducted using
  this system in which 11 subjects went through multiple training sessions, using
  non-individualized HRTF sets. The localization performance evaluations showed reduction
  of overall localization angle error over repeated training sessions, reflecting
  lower front-back confusion rates.
