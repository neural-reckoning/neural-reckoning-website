abstract: There are a number of detailed models of auditory neurons that are able
  to reproduce a wide range of phenomena. However, using these models to test hypotheses
  can be challenging, as they have many parameters and complex interacting subsystems.
  This makes it difficult to investigate the function of a mechanism by varying just
  one parameter in isolation, or to assess the robustness of a model by systematically
  varying many parameters. In some cases, by limiting the scope of a model to testing
  a specific hypothesis using a particular set of stimuli, it is possible to create
  a reduced mathematical model with relatively few, independent parameters. This has
  considerable advantages with respect to the problems above. In particular, if a
  certain behavior is robust and does not depend on finely tuned parameters, then
  different implementations are more likely to produce the same resultsâ€”a key property
  for reproducible research. In addition, the code for these models is typically simpler
  and therefore more readable, and can often run faster, enabling us to carry out
  systematic parameter exploration. I will illustrate these points with a reduced
  model of chopper cells in the ventral cochlear nucleus.
