abstract: The computation of binaural cues such as the Interaural Time Difference
  (ITD) and Interaural Level Difference (ILD) by the auditory system is known to play
  an important role in spatial hearing. It is not yet understood how such computations
  are performed in realistic acoustic environments where noise and reverberations
  are present. It has been hypothesized that robust sound localization is achieved
  through the extraction of the ITD information in the rising part of amplitude modulated
  (AM) sounds. Dietz et al. (2013) tested this hypothesis using psychoacoustics and
  MEG experiments. They presented AM sounds with ITDs varying during the course of
  one AM cycle. Their results showed that participants preferentially extracted the
  ITD information in the rising portion of the AM cycle. We designed a computational
  model of the auditory pathway to investigate the neural mechanisms involved in this
  process. Two mechanisms were tested. The first one corresponds to the adaptation
  in the auditory nerve fibers. The second mechanism occurs after coincidence detection
  and involves a winner-take-all network of ITD sensitive neurons. Both mechanisms
  qualitatively accounted for the data, consequently we suggest further experiments
  based on similar stimuli to distinguish between the two mechanisms. Dietz et al.
