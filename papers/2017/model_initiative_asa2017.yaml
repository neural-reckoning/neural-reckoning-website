abstract: 'A framework aimed at improving the testability and comparability of binaural
  models will be presented. The framework consists of two key elements: (1) a repository
  of testing software that evaluates the models against published data and (2) a model
  repository. While the framework is also intended for physiological data, the planned
  initial contribution will be psychoacoustical data together with their psychoacoustical
  testing protocols, as well as existing binaural models from available auditory toolboxes.
  Researchers will be invited to provide their established as well as newly developed
  models in whatever programming language they prefer, given the models are compatibility
  with the proposed interface to the testing software. This entails that the models
  act as artificial observers, testable with exactly the same procedure as the human
  subjects. A simple communication protocol based on wav and txt-files is proposed
  because these are supported by every programming environment, and are able connect
  models and testing software of any programming language. Examples will illustrate
  the principle of testing models with unaltered signal processing stages on various
  seminal data sets such as tone detection in so-called double-delayed masking noise,
  or lateralization of Â¾-period delayed noise and sounds with temporally asymmetric
  envelopes.'
