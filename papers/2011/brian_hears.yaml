abstract: |-
  The human cochlea includes about 3000 inner hair cells which filter
  sounds at frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. This massively parallel
  frequency analysis is reflected in models of auditory processing, which
  are often based on banks of filters. However, existing implementations
  do not exploit this parallelism. Here we propose algorithms to simulate
  these models by vectorizing computation over frequency channels, which
  are implemented in "Brian Hears," a library for the spiking neural
  network simulator package "Brian." This approach allows us to use
  high-level programming languages such as Python, because with vectorized
  operations, the computational cost of interpretation represents a small
  fraction of the total cost. This makes it possible to define and
  simulate complex models in a simple way, while all previous
  implementations were model-specific. In addition, we show that these
  algorithms can be naturally parallelized using graphics processing
  units, yielding substantial speed improvements. We demonstrate these
  algorithms with several state-of-the-art cochlear models, and show that
  they compare favorably with existing, less flexible, implementations.
