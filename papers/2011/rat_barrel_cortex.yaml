abstract: "In the neocortex, neuronal selectivities for multiple sensorimotor\nmodalities\
  \ are often distributed in topographical maps thought to emerge\nduring a restricted\
  \ period in early postnatal development. Rodent barrel\ncortex contains a somatotopic\
  \ map for vibrissa identity, but the\nexistence of maps representing other tactile\
  \ features has not been\nclearly demonstrated. We addressed the issue of the existence\
  \ in the rat\ncortex of an intrabarrel map for vibrissa movement direction using\
  \ in\nvivo two-photon imaging. We discovered that the emergence of a direction\n\
  map in rat barrel cortex occurs long after all known critical periods\nin the somatosensory\
  \ system. This map is remarkably specific, taking a\npinwheel-like form centered\
  \ near the barrel center and aligned to the\nbarrel cortex somatotopy. We suggest\
  \ that this map may arise from\nintracortical mechanisms and demonstrate by simulation\
  \ that the\ncombination of spike-timing-dependent plasticity at synapses between\n\
  layer 4 and layer 2/3 and realistic pad stimulation is sufficient to\nproduce such\
  \ a map. Its late emergence long after other classical maps\nsuggests that experience-dependent\
  \ map formation and refinement continue\nthroughout adult life. "
