  Computational modeling is increasingly used to understand the function
  of neural circuits in systems neuroscience. These studies require
  models of individual neurons with realistic input-output properties.
  Recently, it was found that spiking models can accurately predict the
  precisely timed spike trains produced by cortical neurons in response to
  somatically injected currents, if properly fitted. This requires fitting
  techniques that are efficient and flexible enough to easily test
  different candidate models. We present a generic solution, based on the
  Brian simulator (a neural network simulator in Python), which allows the
  user to define and fit arbitrary neuron models to electrophysiological
  recordings. It relies on vectorization and parallel computing techniques
  to achieve efficiency. We demonstrate its use on neural recordings in
  the barrel cortex and in the auditory brainstem, and confirm that simple
  adaptive spiking models can accurately predict the response of cortical
  neurons. Finally, we show how a complex multicompartmental model can be
  reduced to a simple effective spiking model.
