abstract: |-
  High-level languages (Matlab, Python) are popular in neuroscience
  because they are flexible and accelerate development. However, for
  simulating spiking neural networks, the cost of interpretation is a
  bottleneck. We describe a set of algorithms to simulate large spiking
  neural networks efficiently with high-level languages using vector-based
  operations. These algorithms constitute the core of Brian, a spiking
  neural network simulator written in the Python language. Vectorized
  simulation makes it possible to combine the flexibility of high-level
  languages with the computational efficiency usually associated with
  compiled languages.
