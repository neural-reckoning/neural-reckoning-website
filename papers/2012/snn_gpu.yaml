abstract: |-
  Modern graphics cards contain hundreds of cores that can be programmed
  for intensive calculations. They are beginning to be used for spiking
  neural network simulations. The goal is to make parallel simulation of
  spiking neural networks available to a large audience, without the
  requirements of a cluster. We review the ongoing efforts towards this
  goal, and we outline the main difficulties.
