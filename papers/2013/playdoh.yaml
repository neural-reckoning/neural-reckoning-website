abstract: |-
  Parallel computing is now an essential paradigm for high performance
  scientific computing. Most existing hardware and software solutions are
  expensive or difficult to use. We developed Playdoh, a Python library
  for distributing computations across the free computing units available
  in a small network of multicore computers. Playdoh supports independent
  and loosely coupled parallel problems such as global optimisations,
  Monte Carlo simulations and numerical integration of partial
  differential equations. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use
  and should be of interest to scientists wanting to turn their lab
  computers into a small cluster at no cost.
