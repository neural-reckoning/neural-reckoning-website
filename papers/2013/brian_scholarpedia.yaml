abstract: "Brian is an open source Python package for developing simulations of\n\
  networks of spiking neurons. The design is aimed at minimizing users'\ndevelopment\
  \ time, with execution speed a secondary goal. Users specify\nneuron and synapse\
  \ models by giving their equations in standard\nmathematical form, create groups\
  \ of neurons and connect them via\nsynapses. The intent is to make the process as\
  \ flexible as possible, so\nthat researchers are not restricted to using neuron\
  \ and synapse models\nalready built in to the simulator. The entire simulator is\
  \ written in\nPython, using the NumPy and SciPy numerical and scientific computing\n\
  packages. Parts of the simulator can optionally be run using C++ code\ngenerated\
  \ on the fly (Goodman 2010). Computationally, Brian uses\nvectorization techniques\
  \ (Brette and Goodman 2011), so that for large\nnumbers of neurons, execution speed\
  \ is of the same order of magnitude\nas C++ code (Goodman and Brette 2008, 2009).\
