abstract: "The activity of sensory neural populations carries information about the\n\
  environment. This may be extracted from neural activity using different\nstrategies.\
  \ In the auditory brainstem, a recent theory proposes that\nsound location in the\
  \ horizontal plane is decoded from the relative\nsummed activity of two populations\
  \ in each hemisphere, whereas earlier\ntheories hypothesized that the location was\
  \ decoded from the identity of\nthe most active cells. We tested the performance\
  \ of various decoders of\nneural responses in increasingly complex acoustical situations,\
  \ including\nspectrum variations, noise, and sound diffraction. We demonstrate that\n\
  there is insufficient information in the pooled activity of each\nhemisphere to\
  \ estimate sound direction in a reliable way consistent with\nbehavior, whereas\
  \ robust estimates can be obtained from neural activity\nby taking into account\
  \ the heterogeneous tuning of cells. These\nestimates can still be obtained when\
  \ only contralateral neural responses\nare used, consistently with unilateral lesion\
  \ studies.        "
