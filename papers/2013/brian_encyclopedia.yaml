abstract: "Brian (http://briansimulator.org) is an open source Python package for\n\
  developing simulations of networks of spiking neurons (Goodman and\nBrette 2008,\
  \ 2009). The design is aimed at minimizing users' development\n\ntime, with execution\
  \ speed as secondary goal. Users specify neuron and\nsynapse models by giving their\
  \ equations in standard mathematical form,\ncreate groups of neurons, and connect\
  \ them via synapses. The intent is\nto make the process as flexible as possible\
  \ so that researchers are not\nrestricted to using neuron and synapse models already\
  \ built into the\nsimulator. The entire simulator is written in Python, using the\
  \ NumPy\nand SciPy numerical and scientific computing packages. Parts of the\nsimulator\
  \ can optionally be run using C++ code generated on the fly\n(Goodman 2010). Computationally,\
  \ Brian uses vectorization techniques\n(Brette and Goodman 2011) so that for large\
  \ numbers of neurons,\nexecution speed is of the same order of magnitude ... "
