abstract: "Simulating biological neuronal networks is a core method of research in\n\
  computational neuroscience. A full specification of such a network model\nincludes\
  \ a description of the dynamics and state changes of neurons and\nsynapses, as well\
  \ as the synaptic connectivity patterns and the initial\nvalues of all parameters.\
  \ A standard approach in neuronal modeling\nsoftware is to build network models\
  \ based on a library of pre-defined\ncomponents and mechanisms; if a model component\
  \ does not yet exist, it\nhas to be defined in a special-purpose or general low-level\
  \ language and\npotentially be compiled and linked with the simulator. Here we propose\n\
  an alternative approach that allows flexible definition of models by\nwriting textual\
  \ descriptions based on mathematical notation. We\ndemonstrate that this approach\
  \ allows the definition of a wide range of\nmodels with minimal syntax. Furthermore,\
  \ such explicit model\ndescriptions allow the generation of executable code for\
  \ various target\nlanguages and devices, since the description is not tied to an\n\
  implementation. Finally, this approach also has advantages for\nreadability and\
  \ reproducibility, because the model description is fully\nexplicit, and because\
  \ it can be automatically parsed and transformed\ninto formatted descriptions. The\
  \ presented approach has been implemented\nin the Brian2 simulator.        "
