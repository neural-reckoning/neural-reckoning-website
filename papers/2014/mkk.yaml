abstract: "Cluster analysis faces two problems in high dimensions: the \"curse of\n\
  dimensionality\" that can lead to overfitting and poor generalization\nperformance\
  \ and the sheer time taken for conventional algorithms to\nprocess large amounts\
  \ of high-dimensional data. We describe a solution\nto these problems, designed\
  \ for the application of spike sorting for\nnext-generation, high-channel-count\
  \ neural probes. In this problem, only\na small subset of features provides information\
  \ about the cluster\nmembership of any one data vector, but this informative feature\
  \ subset\nis not the same for all data points, rendering classical feature\nselection\
  \ ineffective. We introduce a \"masked EM\" algorithm that allows\naccurate and\
  \ time-efficient clustering of up to millions of points in\nthousands of dimensions.\
  \ We demonstrate its applicability to synthetic\ndata and to real-world high-channel-count\
  \ spike sorting data.        "
