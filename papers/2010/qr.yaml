abstract: "Complex dynamics deals with the iteration of holomorphic functions. As\n\
  is well known, the first functions to be studied which gave non-trivial\ndynamics\
  \ were quadratic polynomials, which produced beautiful computer\ngenerated pictures\
  \ of Julia sets and the Mandelbrot set. In the same\nspirit, this article aims to\
  \ study the dynamics of the simplest\nnon-trivial quasiregular mappings. These are\
  \ mappings in R<sup>2</sup>\nwhich are a composition of a quadratic polynomial and\
  \ an affine stretch. "
