abstract: |-
  Spike timing is precise in the auditory system and it has been argued
  that it conveys information about auditory stimuli, in particular about
  the location of a sound source. However, beyond simple time differences,
  the way in which neurons might extract this information is unclear and
  the potential computational advantages are unknown. The computational
  difficulty of this task for an animal is to locate the source of an
  unexpected sound from two monaural signals that are highly dependent on
  the unknown source signal. In neuron models consisting of
  spectro-temporal filtering and spiking nonlinearity, we found that the
  binaural structure induced by spatialized sounds is mapped to synchrony
  patterns that depend on source location rather than on source signal.
  Location-specific synchrony patterns would then result in the activation
  of location-specific assemblies of postsynaptic neurons. We designed a
  spiking neuron model which exploited this principle to locate a variety
  of sound sources in a virtual acoustic environment using measured human
  head-related transfer functions. The model was able to accurately
  estimate the location of previously unknown sounds in both azimuth and
  elevation (including front/back discrimination) in a known acoustic
  environment. We found that multiple representations of different
  acoustic environments could coexist as sets of overlapping neural
  assemblies which could be associated with spatial locations by Hebbian
  learning. The model demonstrates the computational relevance of relative
  spike timing to extract spatial information about sources independently
  of the source signal.
