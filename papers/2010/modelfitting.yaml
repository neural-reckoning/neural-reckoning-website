abstract: "Spiking models can accurately predict the spike trains produced by\ncortical\
  \ neurons in response to somatically injected currents. Since the\nspecific characteristics\
  \ of the model depend on the neuron, a\ncomputational method is required to fit\
  \ models to electrophysiological\nrecordings. The fitting procedure can be very\
  \ time consuming both in\nterms of computer simulations and in terms of code writing.\
  \ We present\nalgorithms to fit spiking models to electrophysiological data\n(time-varying\
  \ input and spike trains) that can run in parallel on\ngraphics processing units\
  \ (GPUs). The model fitting library is\ninterfaced with Brian, a neural network\
  \ simulator in Python. If a GPU is\npresent it uses just-in-time compilation to\
  \ translate model equations\ninto optimized code. Arbitrary models can then be defined\
  \ at script\nlevel and run on the graphics card. This tool can be used to obtain\n\
  empirically validated spiking models of neurons in various systems. We\ndemonstrate\
  \ its use on public data from the INCF Quantitative\nSingle-Neuron Modeling 2009\
  \ competition by comparing the performance of\na number of neuron spiking models. "
