abstract: |-
  We demonstrate a technique for the design of neural network simulation
  software, runtime code generation. This technique can be used to give
  the user complete flexibility in specifying the mathematical model for
  their simulation in a high level way, along with the speed of code
  written in a low level language such as C++. It can also be used to
  write code only once but target different hardware platforms, including
  inexpensive high performance graphics processing units (GPUs). Code
  generation can be naturally combined with computer algebra systems to
  provide further simplification and optimisation of the generated code.
  The technique is quite general and could be applied to any simulation
  package. We demonstrate it with the "Brian" simulator
  (http://www.briansimulator.org).
