abstract: |-
  Developments in microfabrication technology have enabled the production of
  neural electrode arrays with hundreds of closely spaced recording sites, and
  electrodes with thousands of sites are under development. These probes in
  principle allow the simultaneous recording of very large numbers of neurons.
  However, use of this technology requires the development of techniques for
  decoding the spike times of the recorded neurons from the raw data captured
  from the probes. Here we present a set of tools to solve this problem,
  implemented in a suite of practical, user-friendly, open-source software.
  We validate these methods on data from the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus
  of rat, mouse, macaque and marmoset, demonstrating error rates as low as 5%.
