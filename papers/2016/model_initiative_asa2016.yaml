abstract: 'Many computational models of the auditory system exist, most of which can
  predict a variety of psychoacoustical, physiological, or other experimental data.
  However, it is often challenging to apply existing third party models to own experimental
  paradigms, even if the model code is available. It will be demonstrated that model
  applicability is increased by providing a framework where the model acts as artificial
  observer performing exactly the same task as the subject (e.g., adaptive staircase
  procedure). A possible separation of the actual auditory processing of the model
  from the decision making stage will be discussed, which allows for testing the auditory
  processing of one model in a variety of experimental paradigms. The framework will
  consist of a citable data repository providing the required data for the models
  as well as toolboxes implementing both the auditory models and a variety of experimental
  paradigms. The model framework will be demonstrated with exemplary binaural models
  applied to the three most common binaural psychoacoustic paradigms: just noticeable
  difference (e.g., interaural time difference), tone in noise detection (e.g., binaural
  masking level difference), and absolute judgment (e.g., sound source localization).
  Further development of the framework will be discussed.'
