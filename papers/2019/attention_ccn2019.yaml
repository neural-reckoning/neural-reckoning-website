abstract: |-
  "Listen to the cello in this symphony!" How can we direct selective attention according to different goals, even
  in distracting environments which we haven't experienced before? It is an essential cognitive ability of the
  brain, but remains challenging for machines. We developed a computational model that can identify individual
  digits in images containing multiple overlapping digits, without ever having seen overlapping digits during
  training. The goal-driven attentional selection is modelled as inferring the posterior distribution of latent
  variables (the attended target) in a generative model, conditioned on both sensory input and different semantic
  goals. A neural network model has been build to efficiently carry out the the inference process by predicting the
  most likely results, instead of using classic per-sample based iterative optimization methods which may not
  naturally map onto neural structures. Our model also help to understand how top-down and bottom-up attention are
  combined during perception in the brain.
