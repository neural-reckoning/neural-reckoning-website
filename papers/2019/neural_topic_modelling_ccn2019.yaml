abstract: We introduce neural topic modelling - an unsupervised, scalable and interpretable
  neural data analysis tool which can be applied across different spatial and temporal
  scales. The aim is an approach that can handle the ever-increasing number of neurons
  recorded by high channel count multi-electrode arrays. Neural topic modelling is
  based on latent Dirichlet allocation, a method routinely used in text mining to
  find latent topics in texts. The spike trains are converted into "neural words"
  - the presence or absence of discrete events (e.g. neuron 1 has a higher firing
  rate than usual). Neural topic modelling results in a number of topics (probability
  distributions over words) which best explain the given co-occurrences of neural
  words over time. Applied to an electrophysiological dataset of mouse visual cortex,
  hippocampus and thalamus neurons, neural topic modelling groups neural words into
  topics which exhibit common attributes such as overlapping receptive fields or proximity
  on the recording electrode. It recovers these relationships despite receiving no
  knowledge about the cortex topography or about the spatial structure of the stimuli.
  Choosing neural activity patterns as neural words that are relevant to the brain
  makes the topics interpretable by both the brain and researchers, setting neural
  topic modelling apart from other machine learning approaches.
