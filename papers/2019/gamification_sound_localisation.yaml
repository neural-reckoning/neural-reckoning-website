abstract: Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) capture the direction-dependant
  way that sound interacts with the head and torso. In virtual audio systems, which
  aim to emulate these effects, non-individualized, generic HRTFs are typically used
  leading to an inaccurate perception of virtual sound location. Training has the
  potential to exploit the brain's ability to adapt to these unfamiliar cues. In this
  study, three virtual sound localization training paradigms were evaluated; one provided
  simple visual positional confirmation of sound source location, a second introduced
  game design elements ("gamification") and a final version additionally utilized
  head-tracking to provide listeners with experience of relative sound source motion
  ("active listening"). The results demonstrate a significant effect of training after
  a small number of short (12-minute) training sessions, which is retained across
  multiple days. Gamification alone had no significant effect on the efficacy of the
  training, but active listening resulted in a significantly greater improvements
  in localization accuracy. In general, improvements in virtual sound localization
  following training generalized to a second set of non-individualized HRTFs, although
  some HRTF-specific changes were observed in polar angle judgement for the active
  listening group. The implications of this on the putative mechanisms of the adaptation
  process are discussed.
