abstract: |-
  Brian 2 allows scientists to simply and efficiently simulate spiking neural network models. These models can
  feature novel dynamical equations, their interactions with the environment, and experimental protocols. To
  preserve high performance when defining new models, most simulators offer two options: low-level programming or
  description languages. The first option requires expertise, is prone to errors, and is problematic for
  reproducibility. The second option cannot describe all aspects of a computational experiment, such as the
  potentially complex logic of a stimulation protocol. Brian addresses these issues using runtime code generation.
  Scientists write code with simple and concise high-level descriptions, and Brian transforms them into efficient
  low-level code that can run interleaved with their code. We illustrate this with several challenging examples: a
  plastic model of the pyloric network, a closed-loop sensorimotor model, a programmatic exploration of a neuron
  model, and an auditory model with real-time input.
