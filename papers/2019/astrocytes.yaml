abstract: |-
  Despite compelling evidence that glial cells could crucially regulate neural network activity, the vast majority
  of available neural simulators ignores the possible contribution of glia to neuronal physiology. Here, we show
  how to model glial physiology and neuron-glia interactions in the Brian 2 simulator. Brian 2 offers facilities to
  explicitly describe any model in mathematical terms with limited and simple simulator-specific syntax,
  automatically generating high-performance code from the user-provided descriptions. The flexibility of this
  approach allows us to model not only networks of neurons, but also individual glial cells, electrical coupling of
  glial cells, and the interaction between glial cells and synapses. We therefore conclude that Brian 2 provides an
  ideal platform to efficiently simulate glial physiology, and specifically, the influence of astrocytes on neural
  activity.
