abstract: Traditional sound localization studies are often performed in anechoic chambers
  and in complete darkness. In our daily life, however, we are exposed to rich auditory
  scenes with multiple sound sources and complementary visual information. Although
  it is understood that the presence of maskers hinders auditory spatial awareness,
  it is not known whether competing sound sources can provide spatial information
  that helps in localizing a target stimulus. In this study, we explore the effect
  of presenting controlled auditory scenes with different amounts of visual and spatial
  cues during a sound localization task. A novel, gamified localization task is also
  presented. Preliminary results suggest that subjects who are exposed to audio-visual
  anchors show faster improvements than those who are not.
