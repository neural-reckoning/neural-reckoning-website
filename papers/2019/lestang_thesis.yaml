abstract: "Localizing sounds is an important ability for many species. However, reverberative\
  \ sounds\npresent a signi\fcant challenge to the auditory system as later arriving\
  \ reverberations may carry\nconfounding localization cues. The 'precedence e\vect'\
  \ refers to a set of perceptual behaviours\nrelated to this situation. Studies investigating\
  \ the precedence e\vect observed that the auditory\nsystem tends to focus the core\
  \ of the localization process on the computation of localization\ncues carried by\
  \ the \frst arriving sound. Doing so relieves the auditory system from dealing\n\
  with contradictory localization cues in later arriving sounds. A recent study by\
  \ Dietz et al.\n(2013) con\frmed that human listeners use this approach to deal\
  \ with dynamic localization\ncues. In order to provide an explanation for this \f\
  nding, we \frst tested several auditory models\non the speci\fc task described in\
  \ Dietz et al. (2013) in order to shortlist possible mechanisms\ncapable of accounting\
  \ for the early extraction of temporal binaural cues. We found that the\nbest candidates\
  \ to account for this data are single cell mechanisms, such as adaptation and\n\
  onset \fring, as well as inhibitory population mechanisms. To further understand\
  \ how each\nmechanism contributes to the suppression of lagging sounds, we designed\
  \ more general models\ncapable of demonstrating the principal features of each mechanism.\
  \ We tested these models\nthoroughly and found that all mechanisms were able to\
  \ reproduce the results over a wide range\nof parameters. This \fnding suggests\
  \ that mechanisms responsible for the precedence e\vect\nmay not be specialized\
  \ to perform this speci\fc task but instead may be the results of more\ncommonly\
  \ found neural circuits in the brain. Finally, to facilitate comparing the performance\n\
  of auditory models on psychoacoustical data, we also designed and implemented an\
  \ auditory\nmodelling framework capable of addressing many challenges existing in\
  \ the \feld of auditory\nmodelling."
