abstract: The acoustic cues used by humans and other animals to localise sounds are subtle, and change throughout our lifetime. This means that we need to constantly relearn or recalibrate our sound localisation circuit. This is often thought of as a “supervised” learning process where a “teacher” (for example, a parent, or your visual system) tells you whether or not you guessed the location correctly, and you use this information to update your localiser. However, there is not always an obvious teacher (for example in babies or blind people). Using computational models, we showed that approximate feedback from a simple innate circuit, such as that can distinguish left from right (e.g. the auditory orienting response), is sufficient to learn an accurate full-range sound localiser. Moreover, using this mechanism in addition to supervised learning can more robustly maintain the adaptive neural representation. We find several possible neural mechanisms that could underlie this type of learning, and hypothesise that multiple mechanisms may be present and provide examples in which these mechanisms can interact with each other. We conclude that when studying spatial hearing, we should not assume that the only source of learning is from the visual system or other supervisory signals. Further study of the proposed mechanisms could allow us to design better rehabilitation programmes to accelerate relearning/recalibration of spatial hearing.
